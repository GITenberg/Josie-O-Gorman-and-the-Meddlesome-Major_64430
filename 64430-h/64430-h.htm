<small>JOSIE BECOMES A SALES GIRL</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;Not much on looks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That new girl the boss has just hired. Got
no style to speak of. I reckon they&#8217;ll begin her
at the notion counter. It don&#8217;t take much looks
to hold down a job there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brains, perhaps!&#8221; suggested a trim looking
girl with twinkling grey eyes and wavy brown
hair, noticeable in that it was not so elaborately
coiffured as her companions&#8217;. &#8220;My opinion is,
Gertie Wheelan, that Mr. Burnett thinks more
about brains than beauty where his business is
concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you fool yourself, Jane Morton. He
may hire a plain one now and then because the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
good lookers give out, but take it from me, there
ain&#8217;t a man livin&#8217; that don&#8217;t fall for beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, since you are already so pretty, Gertie,
suppose you give us folks that run to brains a
chance to doll up a bit. You&#8217;ve been standing in
front of that looking glass for ten minutes and
lunch hour&#8217;s most up,&#8221; said a stylish little black-eyed
girl who might have laid claim to beauty as
well as wit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop shoving me, Min,&#8221; begged Gertie.
&#8220;Here, get in front of me. I can see over your
head, you are such a little thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m young yet,&#8221; snapped back Min. &#8220;By
the time I am as old as you are I may grow
some.&#8221;</p>

<p>Age was Gertie&#8217;s tender point and Min&#8217;s sally
drew a delighted laugh from the girls assembled
in the employees&#8217; room of the department store
of Burnett &amp; Burnett.</p>

<p>While they were talking and laughing and
primping a young girl quietly entered the room,
so quietly that she had removed her hat and
wrap and put them away in the locker room before
the group around the mirror was even aware of
her presence. It was the new girl and Gertie
Wheelen was right&mdash;she was not much on looks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
even less than that according to the standards of
the employees of Burnett &amp; Burnett. She was
small, sandy haired, and her features, while not
displeasing, were without distinction; eyes pale
blue and nose more or less shapeless. Her mouth
showed character and her teeth were white and
even. Her complexion was good, being clear and
healthy with a sprinkling of freckles over the
formless nose.</p>

<p>Gertie was wrong about the lack of style. Josie
O&#8217;Gorman, while not modish, had style; a style
that was all her own. She managed by arrangement
of hair and cut of gown to look enough like
other persons to pass unnoticed in a crowd, and
yet Josie&#8217;s dress changed but little with the passing
fashions and her intimate friends declared
that the only alteration of hair dressing she ever
indulged in was to show her ears or not show her
ears according to the latest decree of fashion.
Her dress was always immaculate and always the
same&mdash;in the winter, blue serge with white collars
and cuffs for the day, and white canton crepe
trimmed with lace for evening; in the summer
blue linen took the place of the blue serge and
the canton crepe gave way to white linen or organdy.
Her immaculate state was due to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
fact that she had many gowns of the same model
and innumerable collars and cuffs which she always
laundered herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s her now,&#8221; said Gertie as she caught
a glimpse of the new girl in the mirror over Min&#8217;s
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;She!&#8221; corrected Jane Morton. &#8220;The last
lecture on salesmanship laid especial stress on the
importance of good English.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie bowed politely and smiled pleasantly but
impersonally at the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; said Jane. &#8220;I hope you
will like Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s. It is really a great
place to work. I want to introduce you to the
girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to meet all of you&mdash;my name&#8217;s Josie
O&#8217;Gorman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you to begin?&#8221; asked Gertie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tapes, darning cotton and the like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I tell you?&#8221; Gertie whispered audibly
to Min.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a good counter,&#8221; said Min. &#8220;It&#8217;s in the
middle of the store where you can see everything
that goes on. I tell you a lot is going on here
lately&mdash;more &#8216;kleps&#8217; have been busy. I&#8217;ve been
working for Burnett &amp; Burnett ever since I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
a kid and I know they have lost more in the last
month than they have since I was a cash girl.
Seems like things just vanish. It certainly made
me hot when that box of point lace just disappeared
off the face of the earth. I wish Mr. Burnett
would take me away from the lace counter
and put me over with the safety pins. Nobody
ever bothers to steal safety pins from a shop but
just borrows them from friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie laughed and decided she was going to
like little Min and Jane Morton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think somebody stole the whole box
of point lace?&#8221; Josie asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No I don&#8217;t think it&mdash;I <i>know</i> it. One minute
it was there and the next minute it wasn&#8217;t there.
I reported it the second that I missed it and Major
Simpson, the detective, got busy right off but
it was remnant day and the store was packed and
jammed with bargain hunters and that lace was
gone and gone for good. I sure did feel bad about
it. I had to go up to the office and answer a million
questions and before they got through with
me I felt like I had swallowed the stuff and it was
choking me. There was about five hundred dollars
worth of lace in that box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well how&#8217;d you like to be me and have some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
woman walk off with a whole bottle of perfume at
ten dollars an ounce?&#8221; asked Gertie. &#8220;Old Burnett
was sniffin&#8217; around me so any body&#8217;d a
thought I&#8217;d taken a bath in the stuff. I just
howled and cried to beat the band. I made so
much racket it took six floor walkers and the boss
to pacify me and they finally sent me home in a
taxi. I reckon the next time a thief gets busy at
the toilet goods counter they won&#8217;t call on me
to testify.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your tears cost ten dollars an ounce, do
they?&#8221; laughed Josie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fawncy the thief is someone from the outside,&#8221;
drawled a girl who had hitherto been silent
and who had been introduced to Josie as Miss
Fauntleroy either because Jane Morton did not
know her first name or did not care to use it. Miss
Fauntleroy was a very striking looking young
woman, tall, slender, and broad shouldered; a decided
brunette with wonderfully arched brows and
lashes long enough to marcel, at least so her co-workers
at Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s declared. Her
blue-black hair was done after the latest mode,
with waves and puffs and ringlets galore and
never a lock out of place even after the strenuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
ordeal of bargain day. Her voice was a deep
contralto with a slightly foreign intonation,
although she had divulged to Min that she was
born in Hoboken, New Jersey, and intimated that
she had cultivated the drawl and accent because
she considered it elegant.</p>

<p>Of course Min had handed this information
on to her best friends and it had become common
property at the department store that Miss
Fauntleroy was not near so mysterious as she
would have one think. Her hands and feet were
large but her shoes were stylishly cut and her
nails showed much care and attention. She
walked with a slow swinging gait and seemed
never to be in a hurry, even when closing hour
was approaching. She had proven herself an efficient
saleswoman in the jewel and novelty department.</p>

<p>Josie O&#8217;Gorman&#8217;s ostensible business at Burnett
&amp; Burnett&#8217;s was the selling of tapes and
darning cotton, and so ably did she play the part
of shop girl that no one but her employers
dreamed she was there for any other purpose.
There was nothing in the girl&#8217;s appearance to indicate
that she was the cleverest detective of her
age and sex in the United States.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>Shoplifting had developed into a serious matter
in the department store of Burnett &amp; Burnett,
so serious that they had found it necessary to call
in outside help on their detective force. Up to
this time the detective force had been more or
less of a farce since it was what the younger
member of the firm, Mr. Theodore Burnett, designated
as an inherited failing, one handed down
from father to son to grandsons. The &#8220;force&#8221;
consisted of one old gentleman known as Major
Simpson.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying poor old Simpson is not a
good man, as good as they make them,&#8221; Mr. Theodore
Burnett said to Josie when she reported to
the firm in regard to entering their employ.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good man but poor detective,&#8221; put in the
elder brother, Mr. Charles Burnett. &#8220;See here,
Miss O&#8217;Gorman, we&#8217;ve got you over here from
Dorfield because Captain Lonsdale has recommended
you so highly. I fancy there are detectives
right here in our own city of Wakely that
could do the business for us but you understand
we don&#8217;t want poor old Simpson to know we are
employing outside help. He is very touchy&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And very conceited!&#8221; interrupted Mr. Theodore.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>&#8220;Be that as it may, we don&#8217;t want to hurt his
feelings as he has been with the firm from the beginning.
My grandfather stated in his will that
Major Simpson should have a job with us as long
as he wanted it and after that was to be pensioned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the old duck refuses to be pensioned although
we offered to pay him more for not working
than for working,&#8221; laughed Mr. Theodore.</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather like that in him,&#8221; said Josie. &#8220;But
now to come down to what you want me to do. As
I understand it I am to be employed by you secretly
and you are to turn me loose, giving me
carte blanche as to my methods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; hesitated Mr. Charles, who had his
own idea about how everything connected with
the department store should be run. &#8220;N-n-ot exactly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you are to work it your own way,&#8221;
put in Theodore. &#8220;My brother just means he&#8217;d
take it as a favor if you report to us now and
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally! Well then, in the first place perhaps
I had better have another name to start with
as somebody may know my true name. Not because
of my own reputation as a detective&mdash;I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
none to speak of&mdash;but because of my father&#8217;s.
Perhaps you are aware of the fact that my father
was one of the most able detectives in America,
and that means the world, because we are up with
the French and ahead of the Russians in the detective
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Burnetts did not know it but they had the
tact to pretend they did, so Josie&#8217;s one tender
point was spared a jab. Mary Smith was agreed
upon as a good working name and the notion
counter as a fair vantage point from which to
view the comings and goings of possible shoplifters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like a list of the names and addresses
of all your employees,&#8221; suggested Josie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Miss O&#8217;Gorman,&#8221; agreed the
brothers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith! Just forget my name is O&#8217;Gorman,
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sure! Miss Smith!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this juncture there came a light knock on the
door and without waiting for permission a dapper
little old gentleman entered the private office of
the president. Josie decided that the new comer
was as pompous in the back as he was in the front
and when he seated himself stiffly in a high backed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
chair she came to the conclusion that he had
achieved something which she had hitherto considered
impossible&mdash;for a person to be as pompous
sitting down as standing up. Evidently there
was no doubt in the old gentleman&#8217;s mind that he
was a more important personage than either the
president or vice-president of Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s.
As for the little sandy haired shop girl,
who was no doubt being employed by the firm&mdash;she
was of no importance whatsoever.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to speak with you alone, Mr. Charles.
Of course Mr. Theodore may remain if he so desires,
but&mdash;&#8221; he looked meaningly at Josie,
&#8220;others may retire. New girl, I presume.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;let me introduce you to Miss O&#8217;Gorman,
Major Simpson,&#8221; said the senior member
of the firm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smith,&#8221; hastily corrected the junior member.
Major Simpson did not hear the correction and
Josie was registered on the tablets of the old gentleman&#8217;s
memory as O&#8217;Gorman and O&#8217;Gorman
she was forced to remain, since it was deemed
wiser not to take the present incumbent of house
detective into their confidence and being introduced
by one name and employed by another
would certainly have caused suspicion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>&#8220;I am sorry Brother Charles made the break,&#8221;
Theodore said as he accompanied Josie to the elevator,
leaving his brother alone with Major Simpson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; laughed Josie. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not much on aliases anyhow and really prefer
working in my own name. Please let me have the
list of employees and their addresses as soon as
possible.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE NEW HOME ON MEADOW STREET</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Wakely classed itself as a city, while Dorfield
was content to be listed as a mere town that might
someday grow up. In spite of its size, Wakely
seemed to our young detective to be a very lonesome
place on that first Sunday she was compelled
to spend away from all her dear friends in Dorfield,
where she had lived since her father&#8217;s death.
There were plenty of people in Wakely, too many
people, in fact, making the housing problem a
serious one. But nobody knew Josie and nobody
cared to know her. Nobody paid the least attention
to her at the beautiful old church where she
had gone to worship in the morning; nobody
spoke to her at the clean little restaurant where
she had eaten her Sunday dinner; and now as
she sat on a bench in the city park, nobody in all
the surging throngs out for the usual Sunday
stroll even so much as glanced her way.</p>

<p>Josie was not inclined to be lonesome. She was
too interested in people and things to think very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
much of her own aloneness, but there were times
when in spite of herself she felt a crying need for
a real home of her own; something more than the
partitioned off rear end of a shop, which was
where she had been living for some time before
coming to Wakely. The place was called The
Higgledy Piggledy Shop, conducted by Josie and
her friends Elizabeth Wright and Irene Mae Farlane,
and they had managed it to their profit and
to the delectation of the citizens of Dorfield, who
found in it a long felt want.</p>

<p>If the Higgledy Piggledies did not have what
you wanted they would get it for you, and if they
could not do what you wished done they would
see to it that someone else did do it. For Josie
the shop was in reality a side line of the detective
business, but it was of great interest to her
and she missed the gay chatter of the partners,
the daily visits of her dear Mary Louise&mdash;young
Mrs. Danny Dexter&mdash;and she sorely missed the
kindly interest and advice of Captain Charlie
Lonsdale, the Chief of Police of Dorfield. He it
was who had so highly recommended Josie to Burnett
&amp; Burnett.</p>

<p>&#8220;I almost wish he hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; sighed Josie as
she sat on the park bench in the wintry sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
and watched the people of Wakely swarm past.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t care much who steals the stupid old dry-goods.
It&#8217;s a dull job and I&#8217;d be glad to be out
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! There&#8217;s somebody I know&mdash;but who
on earth is it? Where have I seen that boy before?
Certainly I don&#8217;t remember ever having
laid eyes on his companions, rare birds that they
are!&#8221;</p>

<p>Many persons pride themselves on never forgetting
a face, but Josie might have patted herself
on the back for never forgetting a pair of
shoulders, a set of head, a contour of cheek or
chin. However, she was completely baffled by the
youth who had passed her as she sat on the hard,
cold bench. Our little detective was irritated that
she could not remember where she had seen that
turn of cheek and line of shoulder, so irritated
that she decided the seat in the park was very uncomfortable
and she would trail along behind the
trio and find out something about them. Her
curiosity was idle but was it not Sunday afternoon?
Why not let curiosity be idle as well as
persons?</p>

<p>The man and woman walking with the youth
appeared too young to be the father and mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of the boy and too old to be brother and sister,
yet there was an intangible resemblance to both
that led Josie to conclude they were his parents.
The man was swarthy, black-eyed, and flashily
dressed in a checked suit, gray spats and a brown
derby. He walked with a slight swagger, twirling
a slender cane in his lemon colored gloved hand.</p>

<p>The woman was small, inclined to be stout, and
a great mop of henna colored hair elaborately
dressed in waves and puffs defied oversight and
invited scrutiny. She wore a handsome fur cloak
and a purple velvet hat. Her cheeks and lips were
tinted a bright coral and her nose was powdered
like a marshmallow. In spite of the paint and
powder there was something youthful and attractive
about the woman. She walked with a light
step and had a gay bird-like manner.</p>

<p>The younger man, or boy&mdash;he looked about
eighteen, Josie decided&mdash;had an elegance that his
companions lacked, although they would have been
greatly astonished had they been told that the
quiet unimportant little person, whom they had
passed in the park and who later had passed them
on the sidewalk, considered them anything but the
last cry of elegance and fashion. Josie was able
to get a good look at the trio at a crossing. Undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
the boy was the son of the bizarre
couple. He had his father&#8217;s bold black eyes and
his mother&#8217;s delicate tilted nose and softly
rounded cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&mdash;where have I seen him before?&#8221;
Josie asked herself. &#8220;Never mind, I&#8217;ll remember
someday. In the mean time I think I&#8217;ll find
out where they live&mdash;not that it is any of my business&mdash;but
one never can tell when information
will come in handy in this business of detecting
criminals. Anyhow I don&#8217;t trust those two, although
I reckon the boy is all right. He looks too
young to be anything else but all right and he
looks honest, at least he looks honest in contrast
to his father. My opinion is that the old one is in
checks now but has been in stripes, or should have
been. I wonder what they do. People, I&#8217;ll bet
anything, and they do them brown while they are
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie stopped to look in a window in order to
let the trio get ahead of her and then nonchalantly
followed them at a safe distance. They
talked animatedly and their gestures were decidedly
foreign-like in their swift and jerky repetition.
It was impossible for Josie to catch what
they were saying without seeming too interested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
in them, but it was easy to see that both man and
woman were endeavoring to pacify the youth and
persuade him to do something to which he was
opposed. Once he stopped short on the sidewalk
and Josie came within earshot as the boy said
in a tone of suppressed violence:</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you I&#8217;m sick of the whole game. I&#8217;m
going to quit!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Roy, darling, not just now,&#8221; purred the
woman, and Josie noted that the R in Roy and
darling was softly rolled, giving a slightly foreign
accent. &#8220;Not now when&mdash;&#8221; but the woman whispered
the rest and the listener could not hear what
was the big reason for not quitting just yet, nor
could she gather what the game was that Roy
wanted to quit.</p>

<p>The man said nothing, merely stood gnawing
his moustache in a manner highly melodramatic
and cut the air viciously with his slender cane.
Josie loitered after them, wondering what part
of the city they lived in, what they did for a living,
and in the back of her brain was always the
question: &#8220;Where have I seen the boy before?&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie was stopping for the time being at a
hotel, though she realized it would never do for
it to be known that a shop girl was living so extravagantly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Early in life Josie O&#8217;Gorman had
learned from her illustrious father that in the detective
business no detail was too small to be
overlooked. If one was supposed to be a shop
girl then one must live, eat, dress, act and talk
like a shop girl. After three days at Burnett &amp;
Burnett&#8217;s Josie had come to the conclusion that
shop girls were like any other wage earning girls,
some silly, some clever; some educated, some ignorant;
some inclined to put all their earnings on
their backs, some saving up for a rainy day; but
none of them were able to live in hotels. So, to
play the part, she must bestir herself and find
other quarters. The firm was paying her handsomely
for her time and she could well afford to
keep her comfortable room and bath. She was
tempted to do it and give a false address if any
of the girls should ask her where she lived but
she remembered one of her father&#8217;s favorite
sayings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Oh, what a tangled web we weave</div>
<div class="verse">When first we practice to deceive.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>This old saying had decided the matter for her
and on that Sunday afternoon she had armed herself
with clippings from the &#8220;Boarders Wanted&#8221;
column in the morning paper and was determined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
to go the rounds and settle herself as soon as
possible. The trio she was following turned the
corner. Josie turned after them. Glancing at
the street sign she read that she was on Meadow
Street. Several of the ads were on Meadow
Street. She ran quickly through them.</p>

<p>The man, woman and youth went in at No. 11.
It was a shabby, drab looking apartment house.
Yes, there was a room for rent in that very
house&mdash;&#8220;Widow and daughter wish to rent room
to young business woman. 11 East Meadow,
apartment 4.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie had liked the ad from the beginning.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t flaunt their own refinement in their
ad and they say business woman instead of business
lady. They delicately inform the public that
there is no brute of a husband around. On the
whole I believe I&#8217;ll rent a room at 11 East Meadow.
I can keep my eye on those flashy folk if
I do. I suppose it&#8217;s none of my business&mdash;but
one never can tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie noticed that the interesting trio went in
the house without ringing one of the bells displayed
in the lobby. &#8220;That means they either
live here or are intimate with someone who does,&#8221;
was her conclusion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>Apartment 4 proved to be one of the back ones
on the lower floor. The family who had so interested
Josie had entered the one marked 3. After
ringing the bell of No. 4, Josie had peered into
the dark hall and had plainly seen the fur coat
of the henna haired woman disappear through the
door after the man in the checked suit had opened
it with a latch key.</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles me,&#8221; thought Josie. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take
this room if the widow and her daughter turn out
to be most undesirable landladies in Wakely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortunately they turned out to be pleasant folk
who had seen better days, to which the refinement
and taste in the furnishings of their living room
gave mute evidence. The tiny bedroom advertised
for rent suited Josie perfectly; suited also the
part she must play as a new shop girl at Burnett
&amp; Burnett&#8217;s with but little money to spend on
sleeping quarters.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie did hemstitching and fine embroidery
to eke out the salary her daughter made as a
stenographer. The home was neat, and while
Josie&#8217;s room had only one very small window, it
did not open on a court but had a view of a small
back yard which Mrs. Leslie informed her would
later prove a great pleasure to them all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>&#8220;It is really quite sweet, and the janitor says
that in the spring we may plant all the seeds there
we want to. Mary and I will be much happier if
we have a place where we can dig. We never
quite get over longing for the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everything being satisfactory, Josie moved in
that very evening, the question of references being
waived because Mrs. Leslie had a feeling when
she looked in Josie&#8217;s honest face that she was going
to like her; and since one of the trusted employees
of Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s came from her
county that fact was enough to guarantee the
goodness of any one of his fellow employees.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are sorry not to give you your meals,&#8221;
said Mrs. Leslie, &#8220;but Mary and I live so simply.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t live too simply for me,&#8221; declared
Josie, &#8220;but I wouldn&#8217;t be any trouble to
you for worlds. I can easily get my meals at one
of the many restaurants near here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Mother, couldn&#8217;t we?&#8221; asked Mary.
&#8220;Anyhow just breakfast&mdash;&#8221; and Mrs. Leslie decided
they could manage breakfast and dinner
too. So Josie was installed as a lodger and
boarder and soon the lonesome feeling departed
as she began to think that perhaps Wakely was
not such a dismally lonely city after all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>The Leslies were a gentle, pleasant, kindly pair,
and Josie was sorely tempted to tell them all
about herself; how she happened to be in Wakely
and what her real profession was. But she remembered
in time what her father used to say,
holding up a forefinger in impressive fashion:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know and I know and that makes eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Josie held her tongue. She was such an
&#8220;eloquent listener&#8221; that persons were inclined
to tell her all about themselves and to forget to
ask for the story of her life. The Leslies were
like most others and found themselves chatting
away to their new lodger with little or no restraint.
She found out they were strangers in Wakely,
having lived there only two months, knowing very
few people in the town and none of the fellow
tenants.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t even know the people who live right
next to us,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;Mother says she is
glad we don&#8217;t but I must confess I&#8217;d rather like
to know the boy. He is so handsome and kind of
sad looking. I can&#8217;t say much for the sister,
though. She is handsome enough but at times a
little coarse and rough. The boy is at home only
on Saturday afternoons and Sunday. I have an
idea he and his sister are not on very good terms.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
I have never yet seen them go anywhere together.
I can&#8217;t see why, because if I had a brother I&#8217;d be
tagging on after him all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Especially if he were such a good looking
brother as you say this young man next door
is,&#8221; laughed Josie.</p>

<small>THE NEIGHBORS IN APARTMENT 3</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Josie reported for work bright and early Monday
morning, so early that she was able to have
a private interview with Mr. Theodore Burnett
before the business of selling notions was booked
to begin. He had the list of employees and their
addresses all neatly typed, also in what department
of the store each one worked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may not be able to keep up the farce of
selling notions for very long,&#8221; Josie explained to
him. &#8220;You may have to pretend to suspend me
or something so I can have time to be a detective
but I&#8217;d like to hang on there for a few days so I
can get the run of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suit yourself, young lady! We are in your
hands. By the way, old Major Simpson was
rather curious about you. I do not understand
why he wanted to know so much about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t either. Perhaps he met my father in
days gone by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, Josie could but notice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
that the pompous old detective spent a great deal
of time hanging around the notion counter. He
seemed to be vastly interested in what she was
doing and was constantly bumping into her whenever
she left her department. She even fancied
he dogged her footsteps when she went out to
lunch, and was sure that he followed her all the
way home.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be my beauty that is attracting him,
because there is no such thing; and it can&#8217;t be my
wit, for he has not heard me say a word. It must
be that I look like my father and somewhere in
his profession as detective he met my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a well known fact that Detective O&#8217;Gorman
had been one of the homeliest men in the
service, but such was his little daughter&#8217;s admiration
for him that she never could get a compliment
that pleased her so much as for someone to
say she resembled him in the slightest degree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Major Simpson would have been a joke
to him, but there may be some intelligence in the
old fellow after all. There certainly is if he admired
my father.&#8221; So thought Josie as she
walked through the streets of Wakely, conscious
that a bombastic old gentleman was dogging her
footsteps. In her work of selling notions she was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
sure that never a paper of pins was sold by her
without the house detective&#8217;s knowledge. At first
it irritated her, but in the end she found it an
amusing game to elude his watchful eye.</p>

<p>By carefully studying the list of employees she
soon was able to fit name to face over the whole
store and place each person in his or her proper
department. Then came the job of finding the
address of each employee.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me important to know if any of
them are living beyond their means,&#8221; she explained
to Mr. Theodore when he asked her why
she went to work in such a systematic manner.
&#8220;When persons begin to do that, then it&#8217;s time
to look out. They have a motive for getting-rich-quick,
and sometimes when there is a motive the
action follows fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor old Major Simpson had a hard time keeping
up with Josie. Every evening after the store
was closed the girl made it her business to check
off a certain number of fellow workers, quietly
rounding up their homes, sometimes walking with
them under a pretext of having business in their
neighborhoods, sometimes merely following them.
The panting and puffing detective lost the scent
continually, and then Josie felt sorry for him and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
made it easier for him the next time. Gradually
she made friends with the employees, careful always
to be the listener and for that reason universally
popular. So completely did she efface
herself when she happened to make one of a crowd
that the girls would actually forget her presence.</p>

<p>Miss Fauntleroy, the tall handsome girl at the
jewel counter, was one person to whom Josie
found it difficult to make up. She had a cold manner
and attended strictly to business. The address
given on the list was a suburban one, 10 Linden
Row, Linden Heights, and Josie was forced to
put off looking into her surroundings until the
winter weather abated somewhat in its ferocity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I mind the weather,&#8221; she said to
herself, &#8220;but it would be too bad to take the old
Major out where there are no paved streets while
snow is up to one&#8217;s knees. He might catch his
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a let up in the shoplifting, no trouble
having occurred since Josie entered the employ
of Burnett &amp; Burnett. She had been with them
two weeks and except for the fact that she proved
to be an able saleswoman of notions, she had accomplished
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better dismiss me and let me go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
back home,&#8221; she said to Mr. Theodore. &#8220;You
certainly have no need of me here, and the Higgledy
Piggledy Shop is missing me sorely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all!&#8221; declared the junior member of
the firm. &#8220;We have plenty of need of you. It
may be that there is no shoplifting because the
thief is afraid of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could he know I was here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps others know of the fame of your
father as well as old Simpson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps&mdash;but after all I am not supposed to
be so much a watchdog as a blood hound. If detectives
were simply preventives they would lose
all their cunning and skill from disuse. I am sure
you could find a cheaper watchdog than I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we are not kicking about the price so
why need you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie had had many interviews with the members
of the firm and felt they were her friends
and respected her. She especially liked Mr. Theodore,
who seemed somewhat more progressive than
his brother, but both of them were kindly and
courteous. Mr. Theodore, who was an old bachelor,
had invited Josie to dine with his family; insisting
that his mother and sisters would come
and call on her and that they would be delighted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
to make her acquaintance, but Josie had firmly
refused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not while I am selling notions,&#8221; she had
laughed. &#8220;It would leak out in the store somehow
and then someone would suspect immediately
that I was not what I seem to be. Major Simpson
is already worried about me and my job. I&#8217;ll
wager he is standing outside of this door right
now and his moustache and goatee are both bristling
with curiosity concerning what the business
is that brings me to your private office before
opening hours. He would have his ear at the key
hole if he dared and if his sense of dignity didn&#8217;t
forbid. Why don&#8217;t you take him into your confidence?
It doesn&#8217;t seem quite fair somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fair enough! If he wasn&#8217;t so conceited we
might have you work with him but he is so cock
sure of his own ability. I give you my word, Miss
O&#8217;Gorman, he has never yet landed a shoplifter.
Sometimes they have been caught by clerks or
floor walkers, but old Simpson can&#8217;t see beyond
his own embonpoint. Of course if you want his
help&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens, no!&#8221; laughed Josie, &#8220;but I should
like to know what he knows about me and my being
here, and why he doesn&#8217;t come out and say so if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
he does know who I am. Is he at all peeved with
you and Mr. Burnett, your brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. In fact, he seems especially delighted
with us as well as himself. I can always
tell when he is pleased by the way he smiles on me
and strokes his goatee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Three weeks had passed and Josie felt she was
not earning her salt. Carefully she watched the
lower floor of the store from the vantage ground
of the notion counter. Two bargain Fridays had
come and gone and as far as Burnett &amp; Burnett
could tell not one single person had left their emporium
without either paying or promising to pay
for the goods carried off.</p>

<p>The evenings with the Leslies were quiet and
peaceful. The neighbors at No. 3 left early and
returned late. Josie occasionally caught a
glimpse of the man and his wife but she had not
seen the girl. The youth, she had encountered
twice in the street and still his appearance puzzled
her. She was more certain than ever that
she had seen him before, but where?</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe they are kind and charitable, anyhow,&#8221;
said Mary. &#8220;I met a terrible looking
old beggar in the hall coming from their
apartment and I am sure they had given him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
something because the lady spoke to him in such
a gentle tone and he answered her gently and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they say?&#8221; asked Josie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t make out, but it sounded kind of
foreign. That made me think maybe the woman
has found out there is someone of her nationality
here in Wakely and she is kind to him because he
is from her own country.&#8221; Mary was the type
that always made the best of everything and
everybody.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, for my part, I think it is a great mistake
to encourage tramps and beggars,&#8221; said Mrs.
Leslie. &#8220;Now in the country we never could do
it. If we even so much as fed one tramp we had
a swarm of them coming to us for years. My husband
once gave one an old suit of clothes and some
shoes and after I had fed him Mr. Leslie told him
he could spend the night in the barn because it
was coming up to snow. After that a week never
passed that some disreputable old bum didn&#8217;t
come whining to my back door. It kept up until
we had the road gate painted, posts and all, and
then they let up on us and we began to think that
the first one had put the tramp&#8217;s mark on our gate
and all the others read it and knew we were kind
hearted. Of course the paint destroyed the mark.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>&#8220;What a wonderful mark to have on your
gate!&#8221; exclaimed Mary. &#8220;I wish I knew what it
was and could put one on our door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps one is there,&#8221; suggested Josie,
&#8220;and I saw it and ventured in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any real tramps around here,&#8221;
insisted Mrs. Leslie. &#8220;You, Josie, are less like
a tramp than any one I ever saw. I felt safe with
you from the moment you entered the door and I
never have felt safe with any tramp. I don&#8217;t like
to think that tramps might be coming in and out
of this house and if I ever see or hear of another
one being in the hall I am going to complain to
the landlord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother, please don&#8217;t! What would our
neighbors think of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes mighty little difference what they
think. People who don&#8217;t speak our language and
have tramps calling on them have no business
thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie laughed. Mrs. Leslie&#8217;s feeling in regard
to tramps and foreigners was a common one with
persons born and raised in the country. They encouraged
neither tramping nor immigration.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have two beggars at Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s,&#8221;
said Josie, &#8220;one at the front entrance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
and one at the back. It is against my principles
to give to street beggars but I have a hard time
getting by those two. The Associated Charities
are constantly asking the public not to encourage
beggars but send them to the A. C. so that they
can look into their cases. I am sure they are
right, and good citizens should uphold them; but
beggars such as we have at our front and back
entrances seem to be able to appeal against reason
and I am sure they reap a substantial harvest.
When charitable ladies get up tag days for
their pet concerns they should man the stations
with just such beggars instead of attractive young
girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought begging on the street was against
the city ordinances,&#8221; said Mrs. Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they get around all laws by pretending
to sell something. This beggar man at the front
door sells lead pencils and the woman at the back
goes through the motions of selling newspapers.
She never has the last edition and always whines
if anyone wants change. She is a husky looking
person and I believe is well fed, in spite of the
pretext she makes of dining off crusts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor thing!&#8221; exclaimed Mary. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry
for her even though she may be a fraud.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>&#8220;Of course there is no easy way of making
an honest living,&#8221; laughed Josie, &#8220;whether it
be pounding a typewriter or&mdash;selling notions.&#8221;
It was on the tip of Josie&#8217;s tongue to say lying
in wait for shoplifters. &#8220;Begging is not such
a bad way to spend your time if you are interested
in human nature. Of course it must be
rather hard on the man at the front entrance
because he wears a patch over one eye and part
of his game is to keep the other one half shut.
That means he can&#8217;t see all that is going on, but
who knows? He may be able to see more with
half an eye than many persons can with two wide
open ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The beggar I saw in the hall had a patch
over his eye. I noticed it particularly, and felt
sorrier than ever for him. I&#8217;d have given him
something if he hadn&#8217;t hurried away so fast when
I came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A great many beggars seem to be minus one
eye,&#8221; said Josie. &#8220;I remember reading once
of a great French detective who captured a
notorious criminal, who was operating as a
blind beggar with a patch over his eye, because
the <i>pseudo</i>-beggar inadvertently changed
blind eyes. The detective had passed him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
many times on the Pont Neuf in Paris, where
the beggar had stood for weeks and weeks
whining a pitiful tale. Now this detective, like
all good ones, let nothing escape him, and he had
noticed that the blind beggar wore a patch over
his right eye. One morning the patch had moved
to the left one. That set Mr. Detective to thinking
and he watched the man. When darkness
came the man stopped begging for the day, hobbled
from the bridge into a nearby crooked street
and there he straightened up, took off the telltale
patch and walked briskly along the side walk.
Then it was an easy matter to track him to his
luxurious lair. Begging was merely a side line,
as burglary on a large scale was his real profession.
He was attempting to conceal his identity
under the cloak of a mendicant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I still say, poor fellow,&#8221; said Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I say,&#8221; said Mrs. Leslie shrewdly, &#8220;that
if I were a detective I&#8217;d wonder what on earth
made you, Josie, go into being a shop girl. I
begin to think it is nothing but a side line with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie, being completely off her guard, hardly
knew how to answer Mrs. Leslie. She did not
deem it wise to take mother and daughter into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
her confidence concerning her true business in
Wakely. She blushed and stammered like a veritable
novice at the game of concealment and falteringly
assured Mrs. Leslie that she had been
forced into selling notions because of reverses in
her family fortunes.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure the wages are not so very high,&#8221;
she continued, &#8220;but Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s is a
pleasant place in which to work. Then, too, it is
so nice to be here with you and Mary that I don&#8217;t
mind being in a store all day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie expressed herself as satisfied concerning
her lodger&#8217;s profession but she afterwards
said to her daughter: &#8220;She has a kind of
high-brow way with her at times that makes me
doubt her being just a poor girl; and her clothes,
while they are simple, are made of such good
material. You can&#8217;t fool me on dry-goods. I
tell you, Mary, Josie&#8217;s dresses are made out of
stuff that cost five dollars a yard.&#8221;</p>

<small>JOSIE&#8217;S LITTLE BLACK BOOK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ve talked too much!&#8221; Josie took herself
to task after retiring to her room. &#8220;Mrs.
Leslie has some kind of suspicion concerning me
and it is all my own fault. I wonder what my
father would have done under the circumstances.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took from her top drawer a little leather
book; her most valued possession and without
which she never traveled. It was a chunky little
book, evidently home made. The pages were covered
with neatly written lines which, to the uninitiated,
looked like so much Greek script. It
was in reality a cryptic shorthand invented by
Detective O&#8217;Gorman and known only to him and
his daughter and one other&mdash;a certain criminal,
Felix Markham. How he came to know this family
code is another story altogether. At any rate,
in the United States Josie was the only person
who could make heads or tails of this writing,
as her dear father had gone to that far country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
where detectives find no work to do, and Markham
had fled to China after having executed a
daring escape from the penitentiary.</p>

<p>In this little book the detective had inscribed
many homely sayings, some original but most of
them borrowed from Poor Richard&#8217;s Almanac,
the Proverbs of Solomon and other like sources.
Josie often amused her friends by quoting these
bits of wisdom as though her dear father had
been responsible for all of them. Also in this
book was written much that was interesting and
valuable concerning criminals with whom O&#8217;Gorman
had come in contact; descriptions of their
appearance, habits and peculiarities, as well as the
lists of their aliases and professions engaged in
as blinds.</p>

<p>All of this was interesting reading and Josie
never tired of conning over the difficult script.
Reading between the lines she caught hints of successes
which the noted criminologist was too modest
even to put in his diary, although it was written
in a shorthand known only to himself and
his daughter and was meant for no other eyes.</p>

<p>On this night it was not her father&#8217;s successes
that interested Josie, but his failures. The last
twenty pages of the little book were filled with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
his failures and analyses of why he had failed,
also admonitions to his daughter as to what she
should avoid in the way of pitfalls for a detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you find you have aroused suspicion
in the mind of someone as to your real business
which it is perhaps expedient to conceal, do not
be too quick to allay those suspicions as the person
concerned will no doubt be on the lookout
to trap you. If, in the course of time, you quietly
do or say again the same thing that first aroused
the suspicion in the mind of the person and then,
being on your guard, make some casual explanation,
it will be more convincing than changing
too quickly and appearing for that reason rather
unnatural. For instance, if, the better to catch
a criminal, you have been taking the part of a
lowly person, say a dishwasher in a restaurant,
and inadvertently you show yourself to be educated&mdash;do
not immediately revert to slang and
double negatives to throw the person to whom
you have revealed your culture off the scent, but
rather show other bits of learning and then have
a plausible story ready to account for a dishwasher
knowing something beyond hot suds and
drainers and tea towels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There I am!&#8221; exclaimed Josie. &#8220;I am not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
sure just what it was that started Mrs. Leslie
but I think it was the free and easy gabble about
Paris bridges and luxurious lairs. Now I must
bring up the subject again and talk some more
about the same thing and then give her some kind
of song and dance that will sound plausible
enough to throw her off the scent. Then I&#8217;ll
jump back to the subject of bone buttons and
linen tape and maybe haul in something about a
handsome floor walker at Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Satisfied with the plan, Josie devoutly closed
her little book and went peacefully to sleep, wickedly
hoping that somebody would do a little shoplifting
the next day to keep her from dying of
ennui.</p>

<p>Breakfast was hurried and she had little time
to talk to Mrs. Leslie. One could not be very
tactful nor use much finesse with a mouth full
of hot oatmeal porridge. To talk about the crime
wave in Paris so early in the morning would be
ridiculous. It must keep until evening. Perhaps
she was mistaken about Mrs. Leslie having any
suspicion of her. Mary was as gentle and lovely
as ever and her mother was certainly most considerate
and cordial in her insistence that Josie
should have another cup of coffee. After all, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
had nothing to conceal&mdash;that is, nothing that
would be to her discredit. It was only that she
deemed it wiser to keep to herself her real business
in Wakely. Of course if Mrs. Leslie became
too suspicious it would be a simple matter to tell
her the whole truth.</p>

<p>That morning the girls started to town a little
earlier than was their custom. It was Saturday
and a half holiday. Mary had some extra typing
on hand she was anxious to finish and Josie
wanted to interview Mr. Theodore Burnett before
the store opened. As they stepped into the public
hall of the apartment house they ran into
the same beggar of whom Mary had spoken the
evening before. The hall was unlighted except
for a pale streak of sun that tried to find its way
through the dingy glass of the street door but
Josie did not need much light to recognize the
man as the beggar who sat at the main door of
Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s. The man began a pleading
beggar&#8217;s whine and held out his hand to the girls.
Unfortunately for him Mrs. Leslie opened her
door at that moment to call a last good bye to
her daughter and to remind her of some promised
errand. The sight of the beggar angered
her and she spoke sharply to him:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>&#8220;Begone sir!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It is against all
rules of the house to have beggars in the hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse! Excuse!&#8221; and the man bowed humbly,
shuffling off with bent back and palsied head.
As he passed the irate lady, Josie caught the
flash of resentment that glowed in his one eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother, the poor fellow!&#8221; said Mary.
&#8220;I feel so sorry for him and you hurt his feelings
terribly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d no business in the hall. Perhaps I was
a bit hasty. Here, run after him, Mary, and give
him this penny. But tell him he mustn&#8217;t come
back here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary added a small sum to her mother&#8217;s penny
and hastening after the man pressed it in his
hand. Josie, who was close behind, again caught
an expression on the man&#8217;s face&mdash;a leer of admiration
for the pretty young girl with her fresh
rosy face and kind blue eyes.</p>

<p>A view of him in broad daylight convinced Josie
that he really was the beggar who had the desirable
stand at the front entrance to Burnett &amp;
Burnett&#8217;s and also the realization came to her
that she had seen the man before and that it was
not as a mendicant.</p>

<p>For the second time since Josie came to Wakely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
she puzzled her brains over where before she had
seen or known a man, this time an old one. She
was still in doubt as to the identity of the young
man who evidently lived in the apartment next to
the Leslies, and now a palsied old beggar was
adding to her perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep an eye on him during the morning
and perhaps I&#8217;ll remember,&#8221; she promised herself.</p>

<p>It was a busy morning but between sales Josie
managed to get an occasional glimpse of the one-eyed
beggar at the gate. He, too, was doing a
thriving business. Josie wondered if the woman
at the rear entrance was playing in such good
luck as her rival in the front. Once during the
morning she had occasion to pass by the back
door and could look out at the female newsie.
Straggling iron gray hair was blown by the
wintry breezes across a round, plump face which
Nature had doubtless intended to be wreathed in
perpetual smiles and which seemed with difficulty
to assume an expression of misery and woe. Her
comfortable, well rounded body was arrayed in
pitiful rags. Josie determined to study her more
closely and accordingly when the store closed she
made her exit by the rear door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>&#8220;Pa-a-perrr! Pa-a-perr!&#8221; quavered the
woman in a tone that spoke of utter misery and
dejection.</p>

<p>A genial gentleman stopped to buy one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it the last edition?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-e-ss sirr!&#8221; she whined, &#8220;the very latest.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed her a quarter of a dollar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t an-y ch-aa-nge, sirr.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No change? Well then keep it!&#8221; he exclaimed
with a note of irritation in his voice.</p>

<p>Saturday was a short day for the employees of
Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s and Josie determined to use
the afternoon in looking up some more residences
of her fellow workers. The day was pleasant,
with a hint of premature spring in the air; an
excellent day for checking up on some of the
suburban addresses.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if Major Simpson will follow me.
Anyhow, I have chosen a balmy afternoon for
his jaunt if he decides to take it,&#8221; she laughed.
&#8220;I have a great mind to give him the slip.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the simple expedient of going up one elevator
and down another Josie eluded the old detective,
who was evidently on the lookout for her.
She then quickly made her way to the rear exit
and was out on the street before the old gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
realized that the young person in whom he
was taking such an unaccountable interest had
flown the coop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ding bust it!&#8221; he remarked eloquently, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
come up with her yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Fauntleroy was immediately in front of
Josie, moving with her accustomed slow grace.
The girl was well proportioned and Josie had
not realized before how very tall she was. Being
of rather a diminutive statute herself, she seemed
almost a dwarf by the side of the stately young
woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pa-a-perr, pa-a-perr,&#8221; quavered the old
woman in an irritating whine.</p>

<p>Miss Fauntleroy stopped and holding out a
dime asked for a newspaper. Her voice was singularly
hard and cold but the old beggar seemed
rather amused as she answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my prr-r-ty! Here&#8217;s your Jou-r-rnal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me my change,&#8221; demanded the girl
haughtily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Change? Sur-r-ely you know an old woman
like me can&#8217;t make change.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well you&#8217;ll make it for me or give me back
my dime,&#8221; said the girl angrily, her voice breaking
hoarsely. She snatched the money from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
old woman&#8217;s hand and rudely twisting and rumpling
the paper so that it would be difficult to
sell to another customer, she threw it into the
basket at the beggar&#8217;s feet and then walked
proudly away.</p>

<p>While Josie held no brief for beggars of any
sort, neither those who begged outright nor those
who begged under the guise of selling back number
papers or pencils made of scrap lead, still
her heart was kind and it tried her sorely to witness
the rudeness and direct unkindness of the
inconsiderate Miss Fauntleroy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here! I&#8217;ll take that rumpled paper,&#8221; she
said gently, handing the correct change to the
old woman. &#8220;I can smooth it out and read it on
the trolley.&#8221; She stooped swiftly and picked
up the twisted Wakely Journal.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, lady! I&#8217;ll give you a nice clean pa-perr,&#8221;
insisted the newsie, reaching eagerly for
the one that Miss Fauntleroy had thrown so disdainfully
in her basket. But Josie clutched it
tightly and was soon lost in the crowd, while the
old woman sat dazed and disconsolate, forgetting
to cry her wares as the employees trooped
forth from Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s.</p>

<small>THE MAJOR TAKES UP A TRAIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Josie jammed the rumpled paper in the big
patch pocket of her sport coat and thought no
more about it. She boarded the interurban trolley
which passed through Linden Heights, wondering
if Miss Fauntleroy could be on it and
doubtful whether it were better for her to get
off at Linden Row with that haughty and evidently
bad tempered young woman or to ride on
for several blocks. The crowded car thinned out
as they approached the suburbs. Josie was soon
able to make sure that the girl was not on board.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me off at Linden Row, please,&#8221; she asked
the conductor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, miss, an&#8217; the sign was put up only
yesterday so I know where it is. The streets out
here ain&#8217;t marked reg&#8217;lar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Linden Heights presented the appearance of
much suburban property aspiring to become urban;
streets and avenues named, sidewalks laid
out, curbing placed, everything ready to make a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
thriving, prosperous, homelike neighborhood&mdash;everything
but the homes and the neighbors. The
houses were few and far between and Linden
Row, though boasting a brand new name on a
brand new corner and a brand new row of spindling
linden trees, had not a house to its name.
Josie walked north until the sad young street
lost itself in a corn field; then she retraced her
steps, crossed the car tracks and walked south
until a swamp interrupted her progress, and still
no habitation. Bullfrogs were singing their
spring song in the swamp so Josie felt repaid
for her long ride on the trolley.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means spring is almost here,&#8221; she said
to herself, &#8220;is here, in fact. It&#8217;s a surer sign
than thunder and lightning; surer than the robin&#8217;s
whistle or trailing arbutus blossoms. How
my dear father did love to hear the bullfrogs!&#8221;</p>

<p>So far as Josie could ascertain Linden Heights
was nothing more than a real estate map. At
any rate there was not a single house in the place
with the exception of an old farm house, the mansion
of the original owners of the tract, and when
Josie knocked on the door with a trumped up
plea that she was hunting a place to board, she
was met without much encouragement by an old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
man with a tousled beard and mane who gave her
to understand that he couldn&#8217;t abide women and
wouldn&#8217;t let one of them stay on his place for
five minutes. At least she had found out what
she wanted to know: Miss Fauntleroy did not
live there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very puzzling!&#8221; she mused. &#8220;Why did she
give a fictitious address to her employers? The
first interesting thing that has happened since
I came to this town. I hope it will lead to something.
Anyhow I&#8217;ll watch this strange girl and
find out something more about her. She certainly
was very rude to the old beggar.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the way back to the city Josie decided to
read the paper she had bought from the old
woman, but at that moment she became engrossed
in the conversation of some of her fellow passengers
and the Wakely Journal remained in the
patch pocket of her sport coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only thing I regret about my fruitless
trip to Linden Heights is that I didn&#8217;t have the
company of old Major Simpson,&#8221; Josie amused
herself by thinking. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t call it fruitless,
however, as it may lead to something. Anyhow,
I&#8217;m wondering what the dear Major did in
my absence.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>Had Josie realized what the dear Major was
doing in her absence she would not have been
quite so nonchalant in her idle surmises. No
doubt his actions would have amused her but
certainly they would have irritated her as well.</p>

<p>In the first place, Josie had hardly made her
escape by the rear entrance of the department
store when Min, whose surname was Tracy, gave
a hurry call from the lace counter that in putting
up her goods she had discovered the loss of many
yards of the filmiest and finest lace in stock.
The counter next to her reported missing a very
expensive imported gold mesh bag. A hue and
cry was raised by the excited Major Simpson
and after much pompous blustering he had rushed
to the office of the chief executives where he not
only reported the theft but demanded Josie
O&#8217;Gorman&#8217;s address.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have a suspicion of who she is then,
this Miss O&#8217;Gorman?&#8221; asked Mr. Theodore Burnett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve had my eye on her for days. I
have not been in the detective business for all
of these years without being able to distinguish
a girl of her type from a simple saleslady of
buttons and what not.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>&#8220;Well, you are pretty clever, Major. I hope
you two can get together. You say she has gone
for the day? Do you think she can clear up this
shoplifting mystery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she can if anyone can. Give me
her address and maybe I can overtake her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleven, East Meadow, Apartment 4, is her
address. It is remarkable that a girl as young
as she is can be so successful. She is very clever
I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;altogether too clever!&#8221; muttered Major
Simpson. &#8220;But she will find there are
others,&#8221; he intimated darkly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; said Mr. Burnett uneasily, &#8220;but
for goodness sake don&#8217;t be short with her. I
am sure that through her we may be able to track
down the whole gang of shoplifters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust me, my dear Theodore, trust me!&#8221;
said the Major, patting his white vest comfortably.
&#8220;I will use all the finesse that my long
service in this establishment has fostered. You
need never fear that Silvester Simpson will be
anything but a diplomat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh sure! Sure!&#8221; added Mr. Burnett quickly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave it to you but I beg of you that you
communicate with Miss O&#8217;Gorman at once.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>&#8220;Immediately!&#8221; and the Major strutted from
the office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleven, East Meadow,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;That
is the right address. I have followed her home
often enough to know, but I asked Theodore just
to see if the person had the temerity to give her
real address.&#8221; And the old gentleman, not trusting
his short legs to carry him to number eleven
fast enough, hastily called a taxi.</p>

<p>When Major Simpson rang a bell he did not
simply touch a button, he pressed it, and that
with no light finger but with the end of his
walking stick, leaning heavily against it until
the bell was answered or broken.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie answered it quickly and somewhat
indignantly. She had a sponge cake in the oven
and the noise of the bell was enough to make
it fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, sir?&#8221; but her tone of asperity
quickly changed when she saw who was responsible
for the clamor. &#8220;Well if it isn&#8217;t Major
Sylvester Simpson. Sakes alive, Major Simpson,
how did you find me out? I&#8217;ve been telling myself
every day for two months that I ought to
let you know I was in Wakely because of our
families being kind of hereditary friends, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
Mary and I are living in such a small way,
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Simpson&mdash;Major by courtesy only&mdash;made
up in gallantry what he lacked in finesse.
Not for worlds would he inform Mrs. Leslie that
he was not looking her up at all and was quite
as astonished to see her as she was to see him.
He remembered her quite well as little Polly Bainbridge,
whose grandfather&#8217;s farm was just across
the creek from the Simpson&#8217;s farm. She had
been a little girl when he was a grown man spending
his yearly holidays in the country. He remembered
faintly once having made her a present
of a pink parasol on one of those visits. She
was a very small girl and he was even then a
floor walker at Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s. Perhaps
that was how he happened to know the appeal
a pink parasol has for a little girl.</p>

<p>Now that he had found her he must come in
and see her. Of course it could not be that the
person of whom he was really in search could
possibly be living with Polly Bainbridge&mdash;now
Mrs. Leslie&mdash;who came from his county and was
of honest and respectable parentage as had also
been her husband, people of good blood and reputation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>The Leslies&#8217; living room was homelike, pleasant,
and spotlessly clean, but with a certain feminine
disorder in the way of a work basket open
on the table, a scarf thrown over the back of a
chair, a bit of embroidery on the sofa. This made
an irresistible appeal to Major Simpson who,
though a bachelor, was a great admirer of &#8220;the
ladies&#8221; unless they happened to be &#8220;sales-ladies.&#8221;
These he always regarded with suspicion
as being either incipient shoplifters or, worse
than that even, designing females who aspired
to become Mrs. Simpson.</p>

<p>He settled himself in a comfortable overstuffed
chair, conveniently low enough to allow him to
cross his plump legs, and sniffed the pleasing
odors emanating from the tiny kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must excuse me a minute,&#8221; blushed Mrs.
Leslie, &#8220;but I have a cake in the oven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that sounds like home!&#8221; declared the gallant
Major. &#8220;And when I say home I mean the
country. I fear me the city ladies trust to the
bakers for such&mdash;&#8221; But Mrs. Leslie could not
wait to find out what the city ladies trusted to the
bakers as her cake had been in the prescribed
number of minutes and the gas must be turned
off and the cake turned out of the pan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>The major sniffed again. &#8220;Coffee!&#8221; was the
verdict of his olefactory nerves. Like the Raggedy
Man: &#8220;His old nose didn&#8217;t tell no lies,&#8221;
for in a few minutes Mrs. Leslie returned with a
tray of coffee and some hot doughnuts she had
just finished frying when her bell pealed so loudly
and persistently.</p>

<p>The guest <i>ummed</i> and <i>ahhed</i> with appreciation.
He was self congratulatory that the little girl to
whom he had once presented a pink parasol had
grown into such a fine woman. He always had
been a person of discernment and from the beginning
he had known that little Polly Bainbridge
was of the right sort. It was a pleasant thing to
feel that a pink parasol cast on the waters might
after some thirty odd years&mdash;or was it forty&mdash;be
returned to one in the shape of fragrant coffee
and hot doughnuts.</p>

<p>First, all the county news must be retailed and
a bit of mild gossip concerning old neighbors be
whispered. Major Simpson had long ago given
up the habit of spending his holidays back home
since the old folks had all died off and his ancestral
halls passed into the hands of strangers. But
his interest in all pertaining to his county was as
strong as ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>&#8220;I only go back for funerals, now,&#8221; said the
old man sadly. Mrs. Leslie thought of the last
funeral she had attended in that part of the
world, that of Mr. Leslie, and her eyes filled with
tears. The gay little coffee and doughnut party
seemed in danger of becoming as sad as a wake
but Mrs. Leslie brushed away her tears and smiled
on her guest, filling his cup and pressing upon
him another doughnut. So by simple grace happiness
and good cheer were restored.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now tell me of your daughter. It seems
strange for little Polly Bainbridge to have a
grown daughter. Do you two ladies live here all
alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no! We have a lodger&mdash;Miss O&#8217;Gorman.
By the way, Major Simpson, she <i>says</i> she is employed
at Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie could not resist a slight emphasis
on the &#8220;says&#8221; although she had promised Mary
to try and forget the strange suspicions that had
arisen in her mind concerning her gentle little
lodger.</p>

<p>&#8220;She says right!&#8221; declared the Major shortly,
suddenly remembering that he was a detective
out on a scent. &#8220;What do you know of the
young person?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;nothing at all! She came here in
answer to an advertisement my daughter and I
put in a Sunday paper. We took her in without
references. Come to think of it, her saying she
had a position with Burnett &amp; Burnett seemed to
me all the reference I needed since you were
one of the firm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, dear lady&mdash;not yet&mdash;merely a trusted
officer of the company. But tell me more of this
Miss O&#8217;Gorman. How does she impress you? Do
you feel that she is not&mdash;er&mdash;er exactly what she
pretends to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Major Simpson, it seems wrong to doubt
the girl but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a nice girl&mdash;a lady, in fact, but I can&#8217;t
believe she is exactly what she says she is&mdash;I
mean a girl with a job selling bone buttons and
things. Not that there aren&#8217;t a great many ladies
in shops&mdash;I don&#8217;t mean that there aren&#8217;t&mdash;and
elegant gentlemen, too, but there is something
about her and her clothes&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Her clothes! She seems to me to be
simply dressed, more so than most of her fellow
employees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, but have you felt of them?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>&#8220;Not exactly!&#8221; answered the detective with
dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean the material is so good, it would take
almost a month&#8217;s salary to pay for one of her
dresses, unless she makes a great deal more than
girls just beginning usually make. And she has
all of her dresses duplicated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it only her clothes that made you think
she was different?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, it was the way she talks. I hadn&#8217;t
really had a positive suspicion of her being something
she said she wasn&#8217;t, or rather not being what
she said she was, until last night when we were
sitting around the table reading and sewing. Josie
got to talking about noted criminals and what they
did and how detectives caught them&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just stuff she had read in cheap magazines,
I presume.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not fiction but facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Major became as eager as a hound on
trail. Here were facts&mdash;excellent things for a
detective to know&mdash;and in the possession of a
woman. How easy it would be for him, with
his years of experience, to wheedle this artless
soul into telling all she knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, facts! Now, er-er-my dear neighbor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
just what do you mean by facts?&#8221; asked the
Major, making a great effort to appear unconcerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she spoke kind of familiarly of Paris
and her accent sounded like our teacher&#8217;s used
to&mdash;not at all like pupils. I always have my
doubts about anybody who has too good an
accent in French. I think she felt I was suspicious
of her because she shut up all of a
sudden. Please tell me, Major Simpson, have
you also some suspicion concerning our lodger?&#8221;</p>

<small>TOO MANY DETECTIVES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Major Simpson looked at his hostess with blinking
eyes. Although he had spoken scornfully of
cheap magazine fiction that had no doubt put melodramatic
notions in Josie&#8217;s head, the truth of the
matter was that the old gentleman devoured them
himself in private, especially the ones dealing
with crime and clever sleuths. How often in these
stories unsuspecting women, landladies and lodging
house keepers, were unconscious means of
tracking desperate criminals. The detective
came to a sudden conclusion. He determined to
take into his confidence this gentle lady from his
own county. Anyone who had such a light hand
at doughnuts and could brew such clear rich coffee
must have finesse. She was the one of all
others to help him in his business of determining
a difficult point in his profession. He leaned
forward and grasping the widow&#8217;s plump hand,
patted it tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Leslie&mdash;Miss Polly&mdash;er-er-Polly, little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Polly Bainbridge, I wonder if you will help an old
neighbor and friend in a most important matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Help you, Major Simpson! How can a woman
like me serve such a gentleman as you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Know then, my dear Mrs. Les&mdash;I mean Polly&mdash;I
may call you Polly I hope&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Major Simpson!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, my dear Polly, you have under
your roof a character that is under suspicion. I
serve at Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s in a confidential
capacity as their trusted private detective.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Land&#8217;s sakes!&#8221; cried Mrs. Leslie, who had
an inborn respect for the law and all persons appointed
to uphold it. But according to plays she
had seen and the movies, a detective always wore
a shabby brown derby and box-toed shoes. Here
was her visitor, an acknowledged detective, in
the smallest and neatest of polished oxfords, and
from her chair she could plainly see a silk hat
on the marble topped table in the reception hall,
the kind of hat that might have been worn with
impunity by presidents of republics or prime ministers
of monarchies.</p>

<p>Having under her roof, or rather under her
ceiling&mdash;because Mrs. Leslie had never felt that
the roof of the apartment house belonged to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
her in the least&mdash;having under her ceiling a
suspicious character was not nearly so exciting
to that lady as harboring a live detective.
She reasoned that Major Simpson must be an
excellent detective since he had never divulged
that it was in that capacity he served Burnett
&amp; Burnett, the opinion being in his county that
he was a &#8220;kind of partner&#8221; in the firm.</p>

<p>Tales of mystery had always been Mrs. Leslie&#8217;s
dissipation&mdash;it might be truthfully said her only
dissipation&mdash;and now it was a delightful thing
that what had hitherto been a dissipation should
be put upon her as a duty. Surely everybody
would consider it her duty to assist an old neighbor
and family friend in any way possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help you! Indeed I will. Tell me what I
must do first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me something of the life and habits of
this young person, who has so imposed upon
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she is quiet, gentle, considerate and unassuming.
I certainly have to give her that. She
is never a mite of trouble but always helps Mary
and me about any household tasks that come up,
very much as though she were a daughter of the
house.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>&#8220;Um-hum! Sly, very sly!&#8221; puffed the major.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is orderly and regular in her habits.
Keeps her room as neat as a pin and never leaves
anything lying around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid of giving a clue to her carryings-on.
She is no doubt a hardened adventuress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie thrilled with excitement. She felt
delightful cold chills running up and down her
backbone and her eyes were snapping and her
cheeks glowing as though under the spell of no
less a person than Anna Katherine Green or Mary
Roberts Reinhart. &#8220;The Bat&#8221; himself had not
been able to make her shudder more happily. For
the moment she lost all feeling for Josie, of whom
she was really very fond, but thought of her only
as a character in fiction and herself as the astute
heroine who would track her to her lair.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is very much interested in Mary and me
and encourages us to tell her all kinds of things
about our home in the country. I am afraid we
have told her many family secrets, nothing of
grave importance because we have led quiet, sheltered
lives up to the last few months, but just
stories of the farm and Mary&#8217;s childhood and my
girlhood. She is such a good listener and we have
talked to her very freely.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>&#8220;Of course you have. That&#8217;s part of her
game; to get information of all kinds about neighborhoods
and then work some kind of fraud on
them. She is more than likely to go down to our
county and get in with folks there and steal the
spoons and the registered letters or something. I
tell you, Polly, I know their game&mdash;these slick
ones. I&#8217;ll be bound she has talked mighty little
about herself. Do you know any more about her
home life, where she came from, what she did before
she started to &#8216;do you&#8217; than you did when
she first came to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m afraid we don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But tell me what you think the poor girl has
done?&#8221; asked Mrs. Leslie, who could but feel
sorry for criminals even though they spoke French
with a French accent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done! Why I have my suspicions that she
had stolen from Burnett &amp; Burnett many hundreds
of dollars worth of real lace as well as a
gold mesh bag that is easily worth a hundred.
She is suspected by Mr. Burnett, too, but we are
to go easy with her as we hope to track to their
lair others who were able to get away with thousands
of dollars worth of goods a few weeks ago.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>&#8220;What makes you think she has done it?&#8221;
gasped Mrs. Leslie, her backbone continuing to
tingle deliciously over such expressions as &#8220;Track
to their lair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many things have led me to suspect her,&#8221;
said the Major with impressive gravity. &#8220;She
has studiously avoided my scrutiny and when I
have attempted to follow her on the street she
has with great ingenuity evaded my pursuit&mdash;given
me the slip, as we say in the profession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have followed her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Repeatedly! No doubt you have noticed that
she seldom comes home immediately after closing
hours, but walks around town, up one street and
down another. Now is not that in itself a peculiar
way for a nice young woman to behave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To my way of thinking it is very peculiar.
Another thing is that she has ingratiated herself
into the good will of many of the clerks at Burnett
&amp; Burnett&#8217;s. She has followed the same method
with them that she has with you; always inviting
confidence and never revealing anything concerning
her own life and affairs. I have questioned
some of them closely and all have nothing but good
to say of Miss Josie O&#8217;Gorman. Now that in itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
is unnatural and shows she has a sinister influence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Major Simpson, I fear you are sarcastic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, my dear Miss Polly! Young women
in business are just like young women in society
and are chary of expressions of admiration
for members of their own sex.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why do you think that my lodger has
stolen these valuable articles? What proof have
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None as yet&mdash;but that is where you are to
help me. When the clerks reported the theft to
me, immediately my instinct was to find this
O&#8217;Gorman. It was within a minute of closing
time and I would have gotten her but she seemed
to divine that I was on her heels and jumped into
an elevator. I followed in the next but she came
up as I went down. You may imagine, my dear
madam, how annoying it was to one of my years&mdash;and
I may add, dignity&mdash;to be see-sawing up
and down an elevator shaft in pursuit of a
wretched little sandy haired girl. I give you my
word I went up and down three times, always
missing her like a foolish scene in a motion picture
comedy. Then I took my stand at the front
door, hoping to catch up with her in that way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
but she evidently slipped out the back door and
once more gave me the slip. Now, however, I
have tracked her to her lair&mdash;if such a charming
parlor as yours could be called a lair&mdash;and with
your able assistance I am sure I can catch up with
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not told me yet how I am to assist
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply by keeping your eyes open and reporting
to me at every turn. I want to know every
detail in regard to the movements of this O&#8217;Gorman
person. I should like very much to see her
room. I might gather some information that
would escape the notice of a novice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems kind of underhand&mdash;I mean on my
part, but I&#8217;ll take you to her room and if I get out
of this mess I never intend to advertise again for
lodgers. Mary and I will have to manage somehow.
I know Mary will be greatly put out when
she hears of my helping you. She has taken a
great fancy to Josie. You see, we both call her
Josie by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It just shows your kind heart and your daughter&#8217;s
loving disposition. If I were you, Mrs. Leslie&mdash;Polly&mdash;I
would not mention the matter to
Miss Mary. She might feel it her duty to warn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
the young woman that we are on to her tricks and
she might escape. The fewer who are taken into
a plot the better. But show me the young person&#8217;s
room&mdash;I might say lair or den, because all criminals
are more or less like animals and those
terms are very appropriate. To call your sweet
homelike parlor by such an epithet was criminal
in itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie&#8217;s room was as neat as a hospital, not a
thing out of place. Mrs. Leslie opened the closet
where hung the several dresses of the suspiciously
good material.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just feel of them,&#8221; she demanded, and since
they were merely hanging in a closet the Major
did not deem it too familiar to comply with her
request. It was not as though they were on the
young woman&#8217;s person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, very fine quality,&#8221; was his verdict, his
memory harking back to early days at Burnett &amp;
Burnett&#8217;s When he stood behind the counter and
measured cloths. &#8220;And look at the shoes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie&#8217;s one vanity being her feet, she was very
particular about her shoes. Feet being one of
the many vanities Major Simpson possessed he
was a better judge of shoes than materials for
dresses. On the floor of the closet was a neat row<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
of shoes all on shoe trees and all highly polished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me! A girl standing behind a counter
couldn&#8217;t afford to wear such shoes as these.
Look at the cut! Look at the leather! Every
heel as straight as a die and the ties of the finest
grosgrain. Her shoes would give her away as
masquerading if nothing else would.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inquisitive visitor must then have a peep
in the bureau drawers. All was neat as a pin. The
Major, being an old bachelor and extremely fussy
about his personal belongings, could but be impressed
by the exquisite order of the youthful
criminal&#8217;s bureau.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a pity! Such a pity!&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;But no doubt there is some good in the worst
of them. And what is this little book?&#8221;</p>

<p>He took from the back of the top drawer Josie&#8217;s
precious little homemade book filled with her father&#8217;s
notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said with an air of finality, &#8220;Greek!
Now tell me, my dear lady, what a salesgirl wants
with Greek. It is proof positive. I need look no
farther. Of course I had no notion that I would
find any of the purloined goods here in her room.
Those, no doubt, she has taken to the home of confederates.
Now my task will be to find where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
those persons live and recover the stolen articles
and place the criminals behind bars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How terrible! I can&#8217;t think of Josie in such
surroundings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, you are to help me, dear Polly.
I can&#8217;t tell you what your assistance in this matter
will mean to me. You need have no compunctions
in the matter. Remember that this girl is
false as sin to have palmed herself off on you and
your innocent daughter. She has not considered
you in the slightest. Now promise that you will
telephone me if the least thing arises to increase
your suspicion, or better than that, get a taxi and
come to me immediately. Burnett &amp; Burnett will
reimburse you for any expenses incurred. Here
is my card with my home address and telephone
number in case something should occur of import
between now and Monday. You promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We-e-ll ye-e-s&mdash;but somehow I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you have compunctions. That is
your kind heart. All of the Bainbridges were
kind hearted&mdash;but all of them were also noted for
being law abiding. Now it is the duty of every
citizen to help the law to track criminals. It is
kinder to get them while they are young than
wait until they are hardened to crime. Now this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
young person may be saved if she is cut off from
evildoing while she is yet soft and tender. She
will be placed in a home of correction and taught
a useful trade, while if she is allowed to escape
and pursue her wicked ways she may even end on
the gallows. One crime leads to another and
shoplifting may develop into arson and murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right! all right!&#8221; cried the poor distracted
Mrs. Leslie. &#8220;I promise to do what you
ask of me&mdash;but somehow it seems mighty inhospitable.
I wish my suspicions had never been
aroused.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly! But now that they are aroused I
am sure you will live up to the traditions of your
excellent family and do your duty in spite of any
gentle feminine compunctions you may have.&#8221;</p>

<p>The major had read his hostess aright. His
appeal to the traditions of her family were too
much for her, and although her sympathy could
but be enlisted with the supposedly desperate
young criminal lodging with her, she felt she must
uphold law and order, and before her guest took
his pompous departure she had promised him
faithfully to communicate with him if the slightest
suspicious action on the part of Josie evinced
itself.</p>

<small>THE MEDDLESOME MAJOR CALLS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The jaunt to Linden Heights had consumed a
good part of Josie&#8217;s afternoon but it had given
her food for thought and cheered her up. Nothing
so cheered Josie as a problem to solve. Why
should the handsome, chilly Miss Fauntleroy give
a fictitious address? Why should she be so cross
and heartless in her manner with the fraudulent
old beggar woman? Not that the beggar women
had seemed to mind; on the contrary she had
seemed highly amused by the tongue lashing from
the proud beauty. Rather a pleasant old beggar
woman she seemed. It was rather nice of her
not to want to sell Josie the rumpled newspaper.
She had seemed really distressed that she should
have taken it. That was because she, Josie, had
been decent to her. Josie smiled and patted the
bulging pocket of her neat sport coat which still
held the rumpled journal. No doubt the old woman
was a fraud but she was at least a kindly,
goodnatured one.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>As Josie turned the corner at Meadow Street
she could plainly see two persons coming down
the steps at No. 11. She was sure that one of
them was Major Simpson and the other one the
youth who lived in apartment 3, and whose identity
was still a mystery to her. However, the
problem of who the young man might be troubled
Josie very little at that moment. What occupied
her thoughts was why should Major Simpson be
coming from that apartment house. Could he
have been trying to find her whereabouts? If so,
had the Burnetts disclosed the fact that she was
employed by them, over his head as it were?</p>

<p>Josie had thought for a moment that Major
Simpson and the youth were together, but in this
she was mistaken. They had merely happened
to come down the steps at the same time. The
old man proceeded down the street while the
young one came towards Josie. He was evidently
unaware of her approach, Josie as usual wearing
an aura of inconspicuousness that enabled her to
pass persons without being noticed. But it so
happened that as the young man got within a few
feet of the girl he caught her eye. Josie was sure
that for the flick of an eyelash there was recognition
in his glance. Of course it might have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
that he was aware of the fact that she lived in an
apartment next to the one occupied by his family.
But no! That glance of recognition had something
furtive in it. Again she was sure that she
had seen the youth before. Something about the
spacing of his features was strangely familiar,
something about his chin, the contour of his olive
cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, time will tell, as Father used to say,&#8221;
Josie mused, &#8220;and in the mean time I must get
busy about other things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie&#8217;s manner was, to say the least,
highly artificial when she greeted Josie on her
return. The lady flushed and fluttered, treating
Josie more like a guest than a member of the
family.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me take your coat, do,&#8221; she insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like a cup of coffee and some fresh
doughnuts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly should! But let me come to the
kitchen and attend to myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, I&#8217;ll bring a tray for you.&#8221; So the
hostess burdened Josie with attentions, all the
time with a strained excitement in her manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I saw Major Simpson coming from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
this house, just as I came around the corner.
Could it have been he? He is Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s
private detective.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie was not a good dissembler but remembering
the policy laid out for her by Major
Simpson, she at first pretended she had burnt her
hand on the coffee pot and must run put some soda
on it and then when Josie repeated her question
she feigned not to hear aright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simpkins? Nobody has been here of that
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Simpson&mdash;Major Simpson&mdash;perhaps he
has acquaintances in the building. There was no
reason why I should jump to the conclusion that
he had been here, certainly no personal reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie did not push her inquiry because she
realized that for some reason or other Mrs. Leslie
was concealing something from her in regard
to Major Simpson. What it was she could not
divine, but the lady&#8217;s heightened color and
strained, artificial manner meant something besides
the usual Saturday baking. Her deliberate
misunderstanding of the name of Simpson was
too apparent to fool the astute Josie. She came
to the conclusion that the old detective had been
calling on Mrs. Leslie and for some reason she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
had been told by him to keep the matter a secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mysteries and more mysteries!&#8221; thought
Josie. &#8220;I wonder what Father would have said
to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as she finished her luncheon of coffee
and doughnuts she went to her room, determined
to read a little in her leather bound book. She
opened the top drawer. A sudden consciousness
came to her that someone had been meddling there
during her absence. In the first place her beloved
book was not as she had placed it&mdash;close in the
corner, back out&mdash;but had evidently been examined
by someone and then tossed carelessly back
into the drawer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be such an old maid!&#8221; Josie admonished
herself. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean a thing. Perhaps
Mrs. Leslie had some curiosity about my
belongings. It is pardonable for a poor lady who
has mighty little to occupy her mind to open up a
lodger&#8217;s drawer and snoop around a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wait, what was that? Certainly Mrs. Leslie did
not wear heavy gold cuff links, in fact Josie had
noted particularly that her landlady&#8217;s house
dresses were all made with sleeves cut a little below
the elbow and that she never wore cuffs. She,
then, was not the meddler who had left evidence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
of his or her presence in Josie&#8217;s top drawer in
the shape of part of a heavy gold cuff link. Josie
picked it up gingerly. There was a large heavily
engraved letter S on the flat button.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he had left a visiting card for me I could
not be more certain that old Major Simpson has
been calling,&#8221; laughed Josie to herself. &#8220;But
why? And why is Mrs. Leslie so silent about it?
And above all, how am I to act now? One thing
sure, I must not let the poor dear lady know that
I am on to the fact that she is concealing something
from me. I don&#8217;t believe Mary is in on this
mystery, whatever it is, but I&#8217;ll wait until she
comes home and test it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie put the broken link carefully away in
her purse and then sat down to do a little necessary
mending on her coat, a button loose here
and a tiny rip in one of the pockets. She drew
forth the twisted afternoon paper, throwing it
carelessly on the bed and again she thought of
the proud Miss Fauntleroy and her rudeness
to the old beggar woman. She heard Mary come
in and her mother&#8217;s question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you bring an afternoon paper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I forgot! I&#8217;ll run get you one immediately.
I&#8217;m so sorry, Mother.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>Josie smiled. Mary always forgot the paper
on Saturday afternoon and Mrs. Leslie never
forgot to ask her about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the early edition,&#8221; Josie called from
her room. &#8220;Don&#8217;t go out again, Mary. It&#8217;s
rather rumpled but I guess I can smooth it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie reached for the afternoon paper and began
straightening it out just as Mrs. Leslie appeared
at the half opened door of the bed
room. The girl was astonished to find that there
was a parcel of some sort wrapped within the
folds of the paper. It dropped out on the bed
and then slipped to the floor. Mrs. Leslie stepped
forward and stooped to pick it up but Josie, ever
quick and agile, was before her. The tissue paper
package tore and disclosed a crumpled mass
of filmy lace and, gleaming through its folds, a
golden mesh purse.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; demanded Mrs. Leslie
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know. It seemed to be
wrapped up in the afternoon paper which has
been reposing in my pocket all afternoon,&#8221; said
Josie, coolly. &#8220;How it got there I&#8217;ll leave you
to find out. I must hurry out again as I find I
have an important matter to attend to.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>Josie&#8217;s quick eye had recognized a Burnett &amp;
Burnett tag on the purse and her quicker mind
had traveled like lightning back to the time Miss
Fauntleroy had angrily twisted the paper and
cast it in the old beggar&#8217;s basket. Then she remembered
how loath the old woman had been
to let her buy that particular paper.</p>

<p>She stuffed the parcel of lace in her pocket,
placed the delicately wrought mesh bag in her
own purse, and without waiting to hear what Mrs.
Leslie had to say she hurried into the street and
hailed a passing taxi.</p>

<small>MARY KEEPS THE FAITH</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Stop her! Stop her!&#8221; Mrs. Leslie called
to Mary. &#8220;She&#8217;s a thief&mdash;an out and out
thief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother! You must be demented!&#8221; exclaimed
Mary. &#8220;Do calm yourself. You can&#8217;t mean
Josie O&#8217;Gorman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do mean Josie O&#8217;Gorman and I rue the
day we ever took her in. I thought all the time
her French accent was too good to be true. Now
I have seen what she has stolen&mdash;seen it with
my own eyes. Her clothes are of too good material
for a girl who can&#8217;t make very large wages
and her shoes are too fine for one who rents a
little room from us&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, Mother! Please calm yourself and
tell me what you are talking about. What has
Josie seemed to have stolen, because I am sure
she has only seemed to have. I could swear she
is honest&mdash;swear it on the Bible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Simpson was right&mdash;horribly right&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
now I must get hold of him immediately&mdash;I
promised&mdash;Oh, but I also promised not to let
you know anything about it and here I have
blurted it out.&#8221; Mrs. Leslie was walking up and
down the living room like a caged tigress, literally
tearing her hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mother, take this dose of aromatic spirits
of ammonia and then sit down and tell me
quietly all that is troubling you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, give me the ammonia, but I haven&#8217;t
time to sit down. I must phone to Major Simpson
as soon as possible. Thank goodness we have
had a phone put in. Only suppose we did not
have one. What a time I would have. I&#8217;d have
to dress myself and go out on the street and
maybe wait in line at a public booth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Simpson! Who on earth? Is he the
old gentleman from our county you used to know
when you were a little girl&mdash;the one who gave
you a pink parasol once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the same&mdash;and he has been here to see
me&mdash;so kind and courtly&mdash;so anxious for our
welfare&mdash;so pleased to see me and anxious to
meet you. He is Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s private
detective and is on the track of this Josie O&#8217;Gorman.
I promised to help him and now that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
have actually seen her with the stolen goods in
her pocket I am going to tell him about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother, you surely cannot bring yourself
to shame a dear girl like Josie. She can explain
it I am sure. She is a member of the family and
our duty is to protect her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all! Our duty is to bring her to justice.
The law is the law and we have no right
to take it in our own hands. I am not saying
I am not fond of Josie&mdash;I cannot help liking
her although I have seen, with my own eyes,
stuff in her coat pocket; a great bunch of lace
that Major Simpson says is worth hundreds of
dollars and a gold mesh purse, imported and
worth I don&#8217;t know how much. She saw I saw
too, and when I asked her what she meant by
having the things she said she was sure she didn&#8217;t
know but would leave me to find out and then
she hurried out as cool as you please. Major
Simpson had just told me, not fifteen minutes
before, that those identical things had been stolen
from the shop and he had a kind of idea from
various things that had occurred that Josie was
the shoplifter they have been trying to catch for
months. Indeed I think he is a marvelously clever
gentleman to track her as he did. I promised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
him I would help if the slightest thing that looked
suspicious should turn up, and now I must keep
my word.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie took down the receiver of the recently
installed telephone and consulting the card
Major Simpson had left with her, called a number.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, Mother!&#8221; cried Mary. &#8220;The only
reason I can bear your doing this is that I know
dear Josie can explain. Perhaps it is best to
give her a chance rather than to go on suspecting
her of a heinous crime. As soon as she comes
in I shall quite frankly ask an explanation of
her and I am sure she will be as anxious to clear
her name of this charge as I am to have it
cleared.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie could not answer her daughter as
at that moment she heard Major Simpson on the
line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Major, it is Mrs. Leslie&mdash;Polly Bainbridge
that was. That girl has come in and with
my own eyes I have seen a package of lace that
looked as fine as fine can be and a beautiful little
gold mesh purse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she, you say? Gone! Gone in the
twinkling of an eye. Up and out before I could say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
&#8216;boo&#8217; to her. She just stuffed the things in her
pocket when she realized I had seen them and
without endeavoring to make the least explanation,
but feigning a kind of stupid ignorance of
what she was doing with them, she clapped on
her hat, pulled on her coat, and was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will she come back, you say? I don&#8217;t know
Major Simpson, I am sure. She has left all her
things here, but I should think she would be afraid
to come back when she knows I know she has
stolen those things. I have no idea where she
went. She just said she had urgent business to
attend to and was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I swear to the things? Well, Major
Simpson, I should hate to have to, but if the
worst comes to the worst I certainly can put my
hand on the Bible and swear that I saw Josie
O&#8217;Gorman put in her pocket a parcel from which
had fallen a gold mesh purse with one of Burnett
&amp; Burnett&#8217;s tags on it and that the parcel certainly
contained a great deal of filmy lace. How
much I could not say as it was twisted up into a
tight package. I am sorry, Major, but my daughter
was in the apartment at the time and I was
forced to tell her of what I had learned about
our lodger. Yes, she is very sad over it and says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
she will ask the girl all about it as soon as she
returns. Mary is just like her father, so kind
that she thinks nobody in the world is wicked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you say she must not mention the matter
to Miss O&#8217;Gorman. All right, Major Simpson!
Mary is a good girl and I am sure she will
obey me, but she is so fond of this Miss O&#8217;Gorman
that it will go hard with her to help trap
the poor thing. Yes, of course I understand it
is our duty to aid the law where criminals are
concerned. I&#8217;ll do all I can, but it goes against
the grain somehow. Yes, she was right down
brazen about the things being in her room. Of
course she didn&#8217;t know I knew anything about
them&mdash;in fact, I pretended I didn&#8217;t hear her
when she asked if you had been here. She
thought she saw you coming out of the house as
she turned the corner. Of course that shows she
has a guilty conscience to think you had been
here. Well, Major Simpson, I&#8217;ll do my best, not
only because it is my duty but because you are
an old neighbor. I&#8217;ll call you if she comes back.
Oh, of course I must pretend it is some other
matter and not call your name because she could
hear me phoning. Perhaps I&#8217;d better go out to
a public booth. That would be best.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>&#8220;You say just call your number and ask for
Mr. Silvester and say &#8216;The lemons have come&#8217;
and you will understand? That will be fine. Well,
good bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary had listened to the foregoing harangue
with a sinking heart. It was easy to gather from
her mother&#8217;s part in the conversation what the
old gentleman&#8217;s share had been. She well knew
her mother&#8217;s failing, if failing it was, a love of
a mystery and how she had always flattered herself
that she knew human nature. She also knew
that her mother&#8217;s kind heart always got the better
of what she was pleased to call &#8216;her better
judgment,&#8217; and if matters should come to a showdown
that she would probably expend more energy
in her endeavor to protect a criminal than
in convicting one. Mary was sure that her friend
was innocent and it was sorely against her will
that she was made to promise that in the event
of Josie&#8217;s return to the apartment she would say
nothing to her about lace, mesh bags, shoplifting
or portly old private detectives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just be perfectly natural in your manner,&#8221;
commanded her mother. &#8220;Behave as I do&mdash;not
that I think she will return. It would be
entirely too dangerous now that she suspects Major<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
Simpson has been here. She certainly realizes
that I saw the purloined articles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But her clothes! What will she do without
her clothes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear, criminals of that sort never
stop for clothes. She may have rooms all over
the city as far as we know and as many aliases
as she has rooms. There is no telling how long
she has been living in Wakely. Major Simpson
says these robberies have been going on ever so
long at Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s and he rather thinks
this girl may be responsible for all of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother! I can&#8217;t believe this is really
you talking this way. Why, Josie is almost like
a sister to me I have grown so fond of her, and
I am sure she loves you dearly. If we should
have suspicion cast on us she would not believe
we were wicked but would do her best to help
us. After all, you have not a thing to go on but
what a silly old man says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Silvester Simpson is far from being
a silly old man. He is an elegant, courtly gentleman,&#8221;
Mrs. Leslie retaliated with some heat.
&#8220;He is not only from our county but from the
very best blood in the county, and what he says
and thinks has much more weight with me than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
protestations of innocence from a little Miss Nobody.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary felt that silence was the only thing with
which to combat her mother&#8217;s argument, so with
a sad face, and wiping away a few tears that she
could not keep back, she endeavored to lose herself
in a book until Josie should return, for certain
she was that their little lodger would return.</p>

<p>Mary and her mother were usually in accord
and both of them felt exceedingly uncomfortable
that a disagreement had arisen. Mrs. Leslie
busied herself with her embroidery, looking up
every now and then at her daughter and sighing
involuntarily. Mary endeavored to read but tears
would dim her eyes which necessitated a furtive
use of her handkerchief. Both of them missed
the gay intimate chatter that it was their custom
to indulge in. Mary was the first to break the
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, Mother, I saw another beggar
in the hall. This time it was an old woman, at
least her hair was gray, though she certainly
could step along at a lively rate. I saw her actually
running up the steps exactly as though a
mad dog was after her. I was coming in our
door and my impression was that she was going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
in No. 3, but it looked kind of prying for me to
wait and see. That Mrs. Kambourian must be
a very charitable lady with the tramp mark on
her door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well! What have we come to? I think
you and I had better go back to the country, Mary,
what with beggars and shoplifters right in the
same house with us. Now in the country we never
had such things happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mother, remember how the Taylor&#8217;s dog
killed our sheep; and weasels slit the throats of
the chickens; and the turtles in the branch got
our ducklings; and the crows ate the corn before
it had time to sprout; and the city man shot your
prize gobbler thinking it was a wild turkey; and
old Uncle Eben&#8217;s pipe burnt up the tobacco barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, but none of those things were human
beings doing wrong, not even Uncle Eben&#8217;s
pipe. Here in the city it is human beings that
worry a poor woman to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you so worried, Mother? I thought you
were rather enjoying yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mary, I believe you are right. I am
enjoying myself and feel that I am living in the
pages of an exciting detective story.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>&#8220;If only it has a happy ending!&#8221; sighed Mary.
&#8220;In detective tales the one you think did the
crime never is the right one and I believe this
tale will work out that way. I am sure my dear
Josie will prove to be as good as we have thought
she was all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right, Mary. Anyhow we
must read the story to the end and not skip any.
If Josie is innocent it will all come out in the
last chapter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then mother and daughter kissed and were
happy again as they sat and waited for the detective
story to develop.</p>

<small>WHO IS MISS FAUNTLEROY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Josie&#8217;s taxi carried her quickly to the home
of Mr. Theodore Burnett. Fortunately she found
him in. The old colored butler who answered
the bell seemed greatly astonished that a young
lady should be calling on the master of the house
and not on his mother and sisters.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean Ol&#8217; Miss, don&#8217;t you lady, I mean
Mrs. Burnett and Miss Lily an&#8217; Miss May?
They&#8217;s all to home an&#8217; I wouldn&#8217;t be &#8217;stonished
if they ain&#8217;t &#8217;spectin&#8217; of you &#8217;case they done tol&#8217;
me tea in the settin&#8217; room at five sharp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Uncle,&#8221; laughed Josie, &#8220;this is a business
call and I must see Mr. Burnett immediately.
Please give him my card.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, lady, but&mdash;well all right! I reckon
I mought jes&#8217; as well take you right off in ter the
liberry if you air so &#8217;termined lak ter see the
boss. He ain&#8217;t so partial ter doin&#8217; business of
a Sat&#8217;day. Don&#8217;t you reckon you mought prospone
it &#8217;til Monday?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>&#8220;No, I must see him now. If you take him
my card I am sure he will see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yassum, but I hate ter pester him so. He&#8217;s
worrited enough what with sneak thieves a liftin&#8217;
goods off&#8217;n the sto&#8217; right under the nose of these
here detecertives he done pay out so much money
to. I hearn him a tellin&#8217; Ol&#8217; Miss sumpen &#8217;bout
it at lunch time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the library?&#8221; asked Josie, determination
in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, lady, it air right back yonder&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter, Uncle Abe?&#8221; The question
was asked by a pleasant looking young
woman whose likeness to Mr. Theodore Burnett
gave Josie the assurance that she was his sister.
She had overheard sounds of an altercation from
the upper hall and leaning over the bannisters
spied Josie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see Mr. Burnett immediately,&#8221; said
the girl. &#8220;It is important and I beg of you to
inform him that I am here. I am Miss O&#8217;Gorman
from the store.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O-O-h! Are you really?&#8221; and Miss Lily
Burnett sailed down the stairs rapidly. &#8220;My
brother has told us a lot about you and we have
been anxious to meet you. Uncle Abe, you must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
tell Mr. Teddy immediately that Miss O&#8217;Gorman
is here. Please come in, and when you and
Brother Teddy get through your business talk
we will be so glad if you will have tea with us.
Now don&#8217;t say &#8216;no.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sweet frankness about Miss Lily
Burnett&#8217;s voice and manner that appealed to
Josie but she felt that for the time being she
must forego the pleasure of tea with the family
of her employer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, but I am too busy to stop
with you to-day,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, promise another day!&#8221; and Josie
promised and was at last shown into the library
where the master of the house and the junior
partner of the firm sat in some dejection, attempting
to read but evidently restless and preoccupied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss O&#8217;Gorman!&#8221; Mr. Theodore exclaimed,
jumping up. &#8220;I have been wondering how I
could get hold of you. Of course I had your
address but no telephone number. I have wanted
very much to have a talk with you ever since
Major Simpson told me he was going to hunt
you up. He found you, did he not? I don&#8217;t know
how the old fellow happened to catch on to your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
being what you are. He is more astute than we
thought. Perhaps calling himself a detective for
so many years has finally made him one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie began to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has found out where I live and as far
as I can make out he has sworn my landlady to
secrecy in regard to his having tracked me. He
has a mystery up his sleeve and for the life of
me I cannot make it out. But I am not here to
discuss Major Simpson and you have not told
me why you wanted to talk to me. First let me
ask you if a shoplifter has been at work again
and carried off several yards of exquisite lace and
a gold mesh bag?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you find that out? Major Simpson
must have had a leakage somewhere. Ah, perhaps
you have seen one of the sales-ladies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse and more of it! I have found the
goods in my own pocket.&#8221; Josie produced the
stolen articles and laid them on the library table.
&#8220;It seems almost too good to be true that my
pocket was the one chosen, and it also convinces
me that my father was right when he declared
truth to be stranger than fiction. A real detective
tale would never sell with such a thing as
this happening in it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>She then recounted in detail the story of how
Miss Fauntleroy bought the paper and then twisting
it up angrily returned it to the old newsie,
and how the woman seemed genuinely distressed
that she, Josie, should take the rumpled paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course these two are the ones to watch
now&mdash;Miss Fauntleroy and the old beggar
woman at your back entrance. Miss Fauntleroy
does not live at the address she gave Burnett &amp;
Burnett.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure? How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am sure, and I know because this afternoon
I went out to the address she gave and
there is nothing but a frog pond at that number
on Linden Row, Linden Heights. In fact, there
are no houses at all on Linden Row. It has but
recently been put on the market&mdash;a half-hearted
attempt at a real estate boom, I fancy, and the
houses are all &#8216;castles in Spain.&#8217; The question
now is: Where does Miss Fauntleroy live and
what connection has she with the beggar at the
gate? We must go very quietly so as not to scare
her off. I am a little uneasy now that you tell
me Major Simpson is to cooperate with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but I did not say that! Merely that he
seems to be aware of the fact that you are not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
just a shop girl. He came to the office in great
excitement a little while after the theft was reported
and wanted your address. He seemed to
think that through you he might track the whole
gang, if gang there is, of shoplifters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That being the case, why should he be so
secret about it when once he found my address?
Why should he not wait until I got home and
talk the thing over with me? Why should he
persuade Mrs. Leslie, the dear lady with whom
I am boarding, to keep so dark about his having
been there? Why, Mr. Burnett, he has even
snooped around my bedroom and peeped in my
bureau drawers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely not, Miss O&#8217;Gorman! How do you
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know because a little book, of which I am
very fond, had been moved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taken away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, just turned around with the edges
out instead of in. I always put it in the corner
of my drawer, turning the back out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Burnett laughed. &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s above! What
an inventory taker you would make&mdash;or housekeeper
for Sherlock Holmes. But, my dear young
lady, why should you think that poor old Sylvester<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
Simpson was guilty of such&mdash;such sacrilege?
Could not your nice landlady have done that?
Did he leave finger prints on the book and have
you examined it with a magnifying glass?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt he did and I would have examined
it and perhaps photographed the finger prints
had it been necessary, but the deft detective did
worse things than leave finger prints,&#8221; answered
Josie, good naturedly accepting her employer&#8217;s
banter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What could be worse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His cuff link broke in my drawer,&#8221; she said,
producing the telltale bit of gold. &#8220;Would you
like to see Major Simpson when I supply the
missing link?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should, above all things. But seriously,
what do you make of his behavior?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Answered like an Irishman! You know an
Irishman always answers an unanswerable question
by asking another,&#8221; laughed Mr. Burnett.
&#8220;Frankly, I don&#8217;t know; but then, I am a plain
merchant and not a young lady detective. If I
had to answer your question off hand I think
I should say that the old man has gone a little
crazy and thinks you are the shoplifter&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; cried Josie. &#8220;You have hit the
nail on the head, Mr. Burnett, and I give you
all credit for solving the mystery of &#8216;The Major
and the Maiden.&#8217; I find very often in my work
that the sane opinion of a sensible business man
who makes no pretense of being able to unscrew
the inscrutable is worth more than all the sleuthing
in the world. I don&#8217;t know why I did not
think of that myself. Of course he thinks I am
responsible for all thefts past, present and future.
That is the reason he has been following me
around so much. And just think, I thought it
was because he knew about my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Josie laughed heartily at her own stupidity,
and Mr. Burnett joined in. At that moment
his sister Lily put her head in the library door
and the other sister, May, looked in over Lily&#8217;s
shoulder and they laughed, too. Although they
hadn&#8217;t the slightest idea what it was all about,
they were sure it was a good joke that was bringing
forth such spontaneous merriment from their
much admired brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Brother Teddy, you need not pretend
you and Miss O&#8217;Gorman are discussing private
business matters if you are laughing like that.
There could not possibly be anything about business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
that would be so funny,&#8221; declared Lily. &#8220;I
met Miss O&#8217;Gorman in the hall. Now I want
May to meet her and I want both of you to come
on in the living room and have some tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed we will,&#8221; declared Mr. Burnett. &#8220;I
have been wanting Miss O&#8217;Gorman to let you call
on her ever since she has been here, but she is
such a stickler in a way for business etiquette
that she has refused. Now, Sister Lily, we have
her in spite of herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie did not mind at all being had in spite
of herself. The day had been a trying one and
it was pleasant to sit by the cheerful grate fire
in the comfortable, homelike living room and have
Lily and May serve the tea while she talked to
Mr. Burnett and his charming old mother, who
was a delightfully witty old lady in voluminous
skirts and a dainty lace cap&mdash;a veritable &#8220;Ol&#8217;
Miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Miss O&#8217;Gorman, I want you to tell the
ladies of my family all about it. They are very
remarkable women and know when to keep secrets.
I am sure what you tell them will go no
farther. My mother is a great reader of mystery
tales and she will be vastly interested in what
you have to say.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>So Josie told all the happenings since she had
come to Wakely&mdash;not that much had happened
except Major Simpson&#8217;s dogging of her every
move&mdash;until that very day when things had
moved fast and furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you actually have the stolen things right
here in this house?&#8221; asked the mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right here,&#8221; said the son, and he went to
the library and brought back the purloined articles.
&#8220;Of course the ridiculous part of it all
is that Major Simpson thinks Miss O&#8217;Gorman is
a clever shoplifter instead of being about the
most successful female detective we have anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh please&mdash;&#8221; blushed Josie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you know you are, at least that is what
your Captain Lonsdale says. I am wondering
what old Simp will say when he finds out the
goods have been returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he will say that he knew all the
time I had the things and I brought them back
because I was afraid of your sending me to jail.
By the way, if I had been a thief it would certainly
have been a dramatic move to bring the
things to you. It would have disarmed you completely,
would it not?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>&#8220;I guess it would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now I must go,&#8221; said Josie. &#8220;I am
wondering all the time what my dear friends the
Leslies are thinking about me. Mrs. Leslie saw
the lace and gold bag as soon as I did and she
expressed her astonishment. Heavens! Do you
think Major Simpson could have informed her of
the theft this afternoon? Of <i>course</i> he did and
now Mary and her mother think I am the guilty
party.&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>&#8220;THE WATERMELONS HAVE COME&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Burnett would not hear of Josie&#8217;s leaving
until he had ordered his car.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you myself,&#8221; he insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But suppose Major Simpson sees us,&#8221;
laughed Josie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, won&#8217;t that be delicious?&#8221; from May.
&#8220;Do you fancy he will think Brother Teddy is
shoplifting from himself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, if he sees me driving around with
a bunch of lace and a gold mesh bag he could
come to no other conclusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! I have been called many things, but
never before a bunch of lace and a gold mesh
bag,&#8221; said Josie, buttoning her neat sport coat.
&#8220;Wait, let me see that there is nothing in my
pockets that does not belong to me, because if
I don&#8217;t look out I&#8217;ll be arrested yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Burnett, &#8220;I am
going to make you promise to come and dine with
us very soon. I want to hear some of the many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
tales of the criminals you have caught up with.
I know you think that is a strange taste for an
old lady like me, but I simply dote on detective
stories and I am sure you know interesting things
that don&#8217;t get in books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do! Please do!&#8221; chorused the sisters,
and Josie promised, although she had her
doubts about the advisability of accepting such
an invitation, certainly not until the shoplifting
plot was unraveled.</p>

<p>Mr. Theodore Burnett&#8217;s car was a new one,
large and elegant, with silver mountings, and
painted a midnight blue. Josie could not resist a
sly smile at herself when the owner helped her in
so carefully. She wondered what Min and Gertie
and Jane would say could they see her riding
around in such luxury.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you had better let me out at the
corner and not take me all the way to my door,&#8221;
she suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; insisted Mr. Burnett. &#8220;I am
not accustomed to dumping young ladies at the
corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>As it was a well known fact that Mr. Theodore
Burnett was not accustomed to driving young
ladies around at all, and since young ladies must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
be driven before they can be dumped, no doubt
he was speaking the truth. Nevertheless, Josie
insisted on being dumped, if not at the corner,
at least not in front of the shabby apartment
house. He compromised by bringing the car to
a standstill four doors from No. 11.</p>

<p>Had Josie not been so occupied in bidding Mr.
Burnett good bye she would have seen that Mrs.
Leslie was on the stoop of the apartment house,
peering anxiously into the winter twilight. She
had seen the handsome car pass and drive up to
the curb and then her little lodger alight with
the courteous assistance of a very good looking
gentleman verging onto middle age.</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore on Mrs. Leslie&#8217;s concern
for Josie had outweighed her suspicions.
Suppose she did not come back&mdash;what then
would happen to her? She regretted exceedingly
that she had permitted herself to be drawn into
Major Simpson&#8217;s plot to entrap the young girl.
Who could tell what temptations she had had?
She thought of her own Mary. Her life had been
sheltered, her rearing, careful, her training,
Christian. Perhaps Josie O&#8217;Gorman had never
known a mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s care. Was it the
part of a Christian woman with a daughter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
her own to try to catch and bring to justice a
poor young thing who trusted her&mdash;she might
even say loved her? How much better it would
be to warn the girl and try to reform her than
betray her and have her sent to prison where no
doubt she would be taught a lesson but in the
teaching might become a hardened criminal. Certainly
Josie was no hardened criminal yet. Criminal
she might be but there was something very
kind and sweet about the poor thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only I had not promised Major Simpson!&#8221;
she said to herself over and over. &#8220;If only I
had not told him about the lace and the gold mesh
bag! He is started now and there is no stopping
him. It would be different if Josie was the kind
of girl that flirted or ran around with men.
There is nothing like that about her at all. She
is so refined, so circumspect. She may be a kleptomaniac,
poor little thing, and not be able to
resist stealing. I have a great mind to go in
the house this minute and phone the Major that
I will no longer aid and abet him in this cruel
pursuit of the poor young thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie had come out on the stoop for the
third time, hoping and yet fearing to see Josie
returning. Just as she had come to the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
to give her old neighbor and friend an ultimatum
concerning her lodger&mdash;since she was so
refined and was not the kind of girl to flirt or
go joy riding with strange men&mdash;the large blue
car came rolling up the street past No. 11 and
stopped a few doors off.</p>

<p>Meadow was a quiet street, shabby and unpretentious.
Few handsome automobiles passed
that way and if they did they seldom stopped.
Mrs. Leslie was attracted by its new and shining
splendor and when it came to a full stop close
to the curb and no less a person than her abused
lodger alighted and stood for a moment talking
gaily with the handsome, well dressed owner of
the car, Mrs. Leslie&#8217;s heart hardened again and
she hurried into the house to inform the Major
that the prodigal had returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;What number? What number?&#8221; was all the
satisfaction Mrs. Leslie could get from her new
telephone. Of course this was most irritating
when she wanted to get the message over to Major
Simpson before Josie should get in the apartment.
The operator was stupid or the line was
crossed or something, at any rate Josie was in
the hall before the connection was made. Then
the distracted lady was sure that Major Simpson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
at the other end bellowed quite loud enough
for Josie to hear him, although she was all the
way across the room from the telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! Well! This is Sylvester Simpson&mdash;Major
Simpson of Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s. What
is it? Who are you? What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie could hardly refrain from calling
him an old idiot. If he had not come from her
county and belonged to such a highly respectable
family she would have done so. As it was she
merely said: &#8220;Hello! Hello!&#8221; all the time
trying to remember what she was to say if Josie
got back. She knew it was something connected
with picnics, but the major&#8217;s bellowing and stupidity
had driven it from her mind. She did
not know why she had connected the cryptic code
with picnics&mdash;she couldn&#8217;t remember that or
anything else. She only knew that Josie O&#8217;Gorman
had come driving up in a very handsome
blue car and had been standing chatting very
intimately with a handsome stranger when, so
far as she knew, her lodger had no acquaintances
in Wakely. Why had the car not stopped in
front of the apartment house? That in itself was
shady. She also knew that she had promised
Major Silvester Simpson to let him know when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
Josie returned if she ever did return. She was
to name no names but merely say that something
that was in some way connected with picnics had
come. She tried to think, but the Major&#8217;s impatient
&#8220;Well! Well!&#8221; at the other and drove
all coherency from her thoughts. She must say
something or she was sure the impatient old man
would pull his telephone out by the roots.</p>

<p>&#8220;The watermelons have come!&#8221; she gasped.
&#8220;They just came&mdash;the watermelons!&#8221; and then
she heard a great spluttering at the other end
of the line and a faint: &#8220;Is that you Polly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes sir!&#8221; she said, and hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watermelons! This time of the year?&#8221;
questioned Josie curiously, and then realized that
something had happened and was still happening.
Mrs. Leslie&#8217;s cheeks were burning and her
usually tidy hair had escaped from its net and
was standing out in a far from respectable manner.
She looked at Josie with sad, unfriendly
eyes, and her mouth trembled as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening!&#8221; returned Josie. &#8220;I&mdash;I
hope nothing is the matter, Mrs. Leslie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Matter! Nothing that I know of.&#8221; But Mrs.
Leslie was too honest to dissemble and suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
she lost all control of herself and sinking into a
chair, burst into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear, my dear!&#8221; cried Josie kneeling
by her side. &#8220;Please, please, Mrs. Leslie,
tell me if anything is the matter. Where is
Mary?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie pointed to the closed bedroom door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head in mute denial.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it something connected with me&mdash;with
me and Major Simpson that has upset you so?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady did not speak, but a tightening of the
hand which Josie held gave the girl to understand
that it was something to do with her and
the old detective that was making her weep.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the watermelons&mdash;are they a private
dish or am I to have a slice? Come now, my
dear friend, for you are dear friends&mdash;both you
and Mary&mdash;please tell me what it is all about.
I feel you are angry with me about something
and distrust me in some way. I must
have a talk with you and Mary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary, whose door was not so tightly closed
that she could not hear her name mentioned, came
quickly into the living room. She, too, had been
weeping, but her mother&#8217;s wild message concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
watermelons had brought on a fit of uncontrollable
laughter and now she was verging on
hysterics. She tried to speak but could only giggle
helplessly.</p>

<p>Josie looked at mother and daughter with a
quizzical expression as much as to say: &#8220;Well
what next?&#8221; Then she drew Mary to a seat and
standing in the middle of the room she spoke in
a tone of patient gentleness and humility.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sure that something has arisen to make
you doubt and distrust me. I am to blame for
this because I have been concealing something
from you that no doubt I should have told you
long ago, but my profession is such that it is
wiser and safer to keep my own counsel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;hh!&#8221; shuddered Mrs. Leslie. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
tell us anything that you will regret. You can
get away now if you go immediately and wild
horses will not drag from me where you have
gone. Indeed, you need not even tell me where
you are going&mdash;but go quickly, poor child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sending me away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not sending you, just allowing you to go before
it is too late. I may get into trouble for
warning you but I don&#8217;t care. I cannot see you
put behind bars.&#8221; Mrs. Leslie wept afresh.</p>

<small>MRS. LESLIE WON TO THE CAUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;No doubt I deserve it,&#8221; said Josie solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if you do I cannot bear to think of
your being there and, although it is not quite
honorable of me to do so, I am going to assist
you to run away. Honor isn&#8217;t everything. A
woman must be human first and a human being
could not stand by and see a poor young thing
like you branded as a criminal with a terrible
jail sentence staring you in the face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear lady, I have not confessed to
being a real criminal&mdash;only not quite honest
in that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is no line to draw where honesty
is concerned. That is what you shall have to
learn. One is either honest or dishonest&mdash;but
you are so young&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mrs. Leslie, what do you and Mary think
I have done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not me!&#8221; cried Mary. &#8220;I am sure of you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
Josie. I simply <i>know</i> you have done nothing
wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mary! Then what does your
mother think I have done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think&mdash;why, you poor dear child, I know
you are a thief&mdash;at least a shoplifter,&#8221; blurted
out Mrs. Leslie. &#8220;Major Simpson has been keeping
his eye on you for weeks and weeks and he
has at last rounded you up. Oh, why do we stand
here and talk? You must be leaving before he
gets here. I have telephoned him that you have
come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;then I am the watermelons,&#8221; laughed
Josie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I meant lemons but I got so mixed because
I was excited. I knew it was something
people take to picnics and watermelons are good
to take although they are only the shipped Georgia
melons we get for the Fourth of July. All
the time it was lemonade I was thinking about.
Anyhow watermelons was nearer to it than sandwiches
would have been. I know you think I
am crazy but I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I know very well you are exceedingly
sane,&#8221; said Josie gently. &#8220;You are simply overwrought
and are thinking aloud. But now tell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
me what it is. You mean you have telephoned
Major Simpson that I have come back and he
will be along soon with the handcuffs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-h-h! Not that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; smiled Josie, &#8220;but I think
you had better let me make a clean breast of the
whole affair and then we will decide what is to
be done. In the first place, I am not a shop girl
at all&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you?&#8221; Mrs. Leslie said to Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t interrupt, Mother,&#8221; begged
Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am a detective brought here from Dorfield
by Burnett &amp; Burnett to find out who has
been shoplifting so successfully,&#8221; Josie continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another detective!&#8221; gasped Mrs. Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, although I must say that poor old Major
Simpson hardly deserves to be called one.
I have thought it best not to tell anyone what
brought me to Wakely since both Mr. Charles and
Mr. Theodore Burnett were opposed to letting
Major Simpson know they had employed someone
over his head, as it were. It seems he has
never yet detected a thing about anybody, and
while they do not want to hurt his feelings they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
are determined to track the thieves if possible. I
was recommended to the firm as a capable person
and was employed by them. We felt I could
accomplish more if I had a job in the store and
that is how I came to tell you that I was a shop
girl. I have never liked having to conceal my
real profession from you and Mary but it had
to be done. Major Simpson from the first seemed
to have a peculiar interest in me and I thought
it was because he had heard of my father. Perhaps
you have never heard of him, but he was
one of the greatest and cleverest of detectives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Detective O&#8217;Gorman?&#8221; cried Mrs. Leslie.
&#8220;Not the man who found Margaret Carson,
the millionaire baby! Not the one who tracked
down the famous counterfeiters at Dempsey&#8217;s
Mill by hiding in a meal sack for a whole day
and night! Not the one who proved the old maid
sister had put rat poison in the chicken salad at
the wedding just to get even with the young man
who was marrying her sister all because one time
he had shot her cat for stealing chickens! Oh,
Josie, to think of my having you right here under
my&mdash;my ceiling for all these weeks and not
knowing you were Detective O&#8217;Gorman&#8217;s daughter.
Why, my husband and I never missed a thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
he did in the way of detecting crime and we followed
every inch of his work if we could just
get hold of it. Of course I knew he lived in Washington
and if you had ever mentioned Washington
I might have guessed, but you see, you never
did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I never did,&#8221; said Josie, whose eyes were
full of tears. How often she had mentioned her
father, expecting him to be known and remembered,
and how often she had been mortified at
the ignorance of other persons. Now, here was
this quiet country woman who had not even
known how to punch on an electric light until
she came to Wakely to live, yet she knew all
about the great O&#8217;Gorman and gave him all honor
and praise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, Josie! I did not mean to interrupt,
but I just had to. I wish my dear husband could
have met you. He was the one that got me so
interested in detective tales. But go on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I left off where I realized Major
Simpson took an interest in me. This interest
manifested itself in a peculiar way but I did not
realize until this afternoon what the poor old
man thought. I was so sure he was trying to
find out O&#8217;Gorman methods of detecting that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
went blindly on my way. The fact is, I teased
the old fellow. He used to follow me around the
street and I&#8217;d keep him guessing and then lose
him. It is a very easy thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Sylvester Simpsons are very good people,&#8221;
murmured Mrs. Leslie, but Mary gave her
a beseeching glance and she desisted from further
interruptions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been walking the streets of Wakely
a great deal because I have been determined to
find out where the many employees of Burnett
&amp; Burnett&#8217;s live, as well as something about their
habits. You see, Mr. Charles Burnett had a suspicion
that the shoplifting was done from the
inside. So while Major Simpson was under the
impression that I was playing hide and seek with
him I have really been on my job, which did not
stop with closing time at the store. This afternoon
I went out to Linden Heights to track down
a young person and found she has given a fictitious
address.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how exciting!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Leslie.
&#8220;Why do you suppose&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but I am going to find out. A
whole lot of things have happened this afternoon
that I have to find out about. In the first place,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
there was a theft of some priceless lace and a
mesh bag&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;h! I forgot that!&#8221; cried Mrs. Leslie.
&#8220;And what were you doing with those things?
That is what has been worrying me sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you I did not know when you asked
me before, and I told you the truth. Since then
a gleam of light has been shed on how I got those
things but it is such a faint gleam that I feel it
best not to say anything more about it until I
can see more clearly myself. I am going to ask
you and Mary to trust me a little longer in so
far as the lace and gold bag being found in my
pocket is concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I have always trusted you, Josie,&#8221;
declared Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well I must say I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; said Mrs. Leslie,
stoutly, &#8220;and I&#8217;d like to know now where those
things are. Major Simpson will be coming along
here before you know it and I am not willing for
him to find them in my apartment. Where are
they, Josie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are where they belong&mdash;with Mr.
Theodore Burnett. I took them to him the moment
I was aware of the fact that they were in
my possession.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>&#8220;Mr. Theodore Burnett! Then was he the
man who came home with you, the one who
stopped three doors up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that was Mr. Theodore Burnett, the junior
member of the firm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens above! And I took him to be one
of your confederates!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So he is, and we happen to be working on
an inside job. It was never my idea to be so
secretive about my being a detective, at least
so far as Major Simpson was concerned, but the
Burnetts were sure he would not know how to
cooperate with me and that if a clue was found
he would bungle because he is so&mdash;so&mdash;I might
say, old fashioned, though that is hardly the word
because the business of detecting crime is as old
as crime itself, and what new wrinkles have been
discovered do not amount to a row of pins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There now, it was that kind of talk that made
me say you were not a notion counter girl,&#8221; said
Mrs. Leslie. &#8220;But you will tell Major Simpson
now, surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not yet! I am afraid he would bungle
things. Mr. Burnett and I have decided to keep
him in the dark as to my business until the real
thieves are caught.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>&#8220;Of course if you catch the shoplifters you
want the glory of it and if you took him in on it
he might get half,&#8221; said Mrs. Leslie. &#8220;That&#8217;s
human nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a snap for the glory,&#8221; laughed
Josie. &#8220;It may be human nature, but it is not
mine and it was not my father&#8217;s. I know you
think this will sound smug, but honestly and truly
the doing of the work is what interests me and
anybody who wants to can walk off with the laurel
wreath. Of course the laborer is worthy of his
hire and I want the hard cash for delivering the
goods. Not that I do the work for money either&mdash;that
is, I don&#8217;t think about the money and of
it while I am doing it. After it is all over it is
rather pleasant to deposit a fat check in the
bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I reckon it is, and it takes money to
dress as you do,&#8221; said Mrs. Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I do?&#8221; laughed Josie. &#8220;Why, Mrs. Leslie,
I don&#8217;t believe there is a girl at Burnett &amp;
Burnett&#8217;s so simply dressed as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply but elegantly!&#8221; insisted Mrs. Leslie.
&#8220;I know dress goods when I see it&mdash;and shoes&mdash;there
is nothing simple about your shoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you are right, my dear lady. I do get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
good material for my frocks and I do wear good
shoes. By the way, what did Major Simpson
think of my shoes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your shoes!&#8221; and Mrs. Leslie blushed furiously.
&#8220;What do you mean, Josie? But I&#8217;m
not going to lie about it. The Major did go in
your room, but he made me feel it was in the
cause of the upholding of the law that I should
take him there. He did not meddle with anything
however&mdash;except&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except my little book in the top drawer,&#8221;
teased Josie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;&#8221; faltered the much embarrassed hostess,
&#8220;but how did you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it in the first place because the book
was not quite in the corner and the back turned
in instead of out. But if I had not known it already
this would have been proof that someone
had been in my drawer.&#8221; Josie produced the
broken cuff link.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear, I am so mortified that I let that
bigoted old man make such a fool of me,&#8221; wailed
Mrs. Leslie. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know the first thing
about the detective business, either. And I
thought he was so clever. You see he is the first
one I ever knew and he talked so knowingly. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
idea of his leaving a cuff link in the drawer! And
to think of his spending all this time tracking
down a detective! Anybody could see with half
an eye that you are as honest as the day is long.
Josie, I am going to do anything you tell me to
keep your identity concealed from old Major
Simpson. I don&#8217;t care if he does belong to one
of the most respectable families in our county,
with his ancestral home right next to mine&mdash;and
I don&#8217;t care if he did give me a pink parasol when
I was a little girl. He is a poor detective and
that is what I am interested in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way to talk,&#8221; said Josie, and the
girls laughed so merrily that Mrs. Leslie joined
in. &#8220;But what line of subterfuge are we to decide
on? It is really very important to keep the
poor man fooled for a few days yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll phone him again and tell him the watermelons
are to be with me for some time&mdash;I mean
lemons&mdash;and he need have no fear of losing
them.&#8221;</p>

<small>A BOARDING HOUSE HERO</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When Major Simpson received the frantic message
from Mrs. Leslie informing him the watermelons
had come, for a moment he stood aghast,
not knowing at all what she meant. Slowly a
wary smile overspread his rotund countenance
and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;By golly! There&#8217;s a woman for you! I&#8217;ll
bet my gold-headed cane that somebody had
caught on to the lemons and she realized I would
have intelligence enough to grasp her meaning if
she substituted watermelons. Of course&mdash;of
course&mdash;picnics back in the grove behind the
church&mdash;ice cold watermelons&mdash;ice cold lemonade.
Even had she said fried chicken I should
have been wise. Well, well! I must not neglect
my digestion for this little shoplifter. Since she
is safe in the hands of my good friend Polly Bainbridge
I can eat my dinner in peace. I wonder
whether or not the stolen goods are still on the
wretch. I fancy not, but once we get our clutches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
on her she will divulge where she has hidden the
loot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Simpson was star boarder in the very
select house run by Mrs. Celeste White. The place
was called &#8220;Maison Blanche&#8221;. Mrs. White seemed
to think that her name Celeste gave her sufficient
reason for assuming a French air. For that reason
at Maison Blanche the bill of fare was always
the menu. The baking dishes were casseroles,
the napkins, serviettes. She made desperate efforts
to have old Aunt Maria called the chef but
that worthy person objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m! I ain&#8217;t no shelf an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t gonter be
laid on none fer many a day yit. I&#8217;m a plain cook
as fer as what you call me is consarned but I&#8217;m
plain an&#8217; fancy as fer as cookin&#8217; is consarned.
An&#8217; what I cook air a gonter be called by the
right name s&#8217;long as it air in my kitchen. When
it gits as fer as the precinct of the butler&#8217;s pantry
it kin begin ter change its name an&#8217; not befo&#8217;. I
cooks maccaroni an&#8217; cheese in a bakin&#8217; dish but
Miss White she make a pass over it an&#8217; by the
time the boa&#8217;ders gits settled in they seats my
maccaroni an&#8217; cheese air fergetti O&#8217; Gratty Ann.
I don&#8217;t know who this here Gratty Ann is but she
sho mus&#8217; a been a great one fer the eatin&#8217;s since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
she got so many things named after her. They
even got pertatters named her name only Miss
White, she calls &#8217;em pums. This Gratty Ann an&#8217;
that there Cassy Roll got they patent hitched on
ter mos&#8217; eve&#8217;y thing these days. In ol&#8217; times
Sally Lum an&#8217; Brown Betty wa&#8217; the onlies oomans
what got they names in the cook book an&#8217; now
them two has ter take a back seat. The times air
sho quare. Miss White she don&#8217;t even let cawfy
be plain cawfy, that is when they dishes it up in
them little doll baby cups, but she got ter name
it after some low flung pusson called Demmy
Task. I don&#8217;t know who Demmy Task is but she
mus&#8217; be a stingy one.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the kitchen Aunt Maria ruled supreme, while
in the parlor Major Simpson was monarch of all
he surveyed&mdash;from the great Mrs. Celeste White
herself down to the humble little Miss Willie
Watts who rented Mrs. White&#8217;s attic room which
she pleased to call a studio. Here Miss Willie
made crayon portraits of the living and the dead
for a living, and for pleasure she painted fancy
pictures illustrating striking bits in mythology
as well as her favorite songs. These pictures
painted merely for the love of what the poor little
woman called &#8220;her art&#8221; she never sold, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
nobody ever bought them. But she was very generous
with them at Christmas and on birthdays
and weddings. According to Miss Willie Watts
everything must be decorated&mdash;no space go to
waste. Art abhorred a bare space as much as
Nature did a vacuum.</p>

<p>Major Simpson was the recipient of several
of Miss Willie&#8217;s efforts. &#8220;The Lovers&#8217; Tryst,&#8221;
painted in a wooden mixing bowl, was touching
indeed. Of course the poor man never did know
what he was expected to do with a wooden bowl
so he did nothing with it&mdash;just had it around.
The small rolling pin tastefully decorated in
new born cupids and suspended by silken cords
and tassels attached to the handles, he guessed
was meant for a cravat holder and so the vivid
pink cupids peeped out from behind the old gentleman&#8217;s
sober ties, constantly reminding him
that the fool that the cynics tell us is born every
minute may also be a lover.</p>

<p>On this evening Major Simpson was in his
glory. The paying lady guests at Maison Blanche
were gathered together in the parlor, listening in
wrapt admiration while the star boarder recounted
with becoming modesty the almost superhuman
intelligence he had exercised in tracking down the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
desperate criminal, little Josie O&#8217;Gorman. Of
course he named no names for fear that by some
means the terrible truth might be conveyed to
his victim and she might escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;How thrilling!&#8221; trilled a sweet young thing
of some forty summers. &#8220;Oh, Major, you are
wonderfully clever! I wish I might see you work.
How will you proceed now? Will you swear out
a warrant and go and arrest the wicked creature?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, not yet! It is most important to
round up all of the girl&#8217;s confederates. In the
mean time she is safe in the apartment of my
friend, the widow from my county&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A widow!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Willie Watts.
&#8220;So she is a widow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Willie was a contented little woman and
envied no woman anything except a dead husband.
In her heart she had always longed to
be a widow. Her imagination could not picture
for her a live husband but she could easily
see herself in a widow&#8217;s ruche with a long
crepe veil. Her imagination even carved a name
on the tombstone marking the grave over which
she mourned so piteously. It was not always
the same name, for Miss Willie allowed herself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
to be fickle in regard to her imaginary dead
husbands; but for many months now she had
thought how blissful it would be to be called
the Widow Simpson and how handsome the
name Major Sylvester Simpson would look
on an imposing marble shaft&mdash;&#8220;beloved husband
of Willie Watts&#8221;&mdash;or should it be Wilhelmina?
Willie would look so boyish on a tombstone.</p>

<p>Had Major Simpson realized the little artist
was regarding him in &#8220;that bony light&#8221; no
doubt he would have refused to let his cravats
hang over the cupid covered rolling pin, but he
merely counted her as one of the many lovely
ladies who did him homage at the Maison Blanche,
listening to his stories and applauding his cleverness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Burnett &amp; Burnett could hardly get along
without you,&#8221; murmured Miss Willie, thinking
of herself as cruel even to imagine the efficient
righthand man of the department store as carved
on a tombstone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they won&#8217;t have to. I could retire to-morrow
if I chose, but the work of a detective is
so engrossing that once one has engaged in it, it
is impossible to relinquish it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>&#8220;Have you always been one?&#8221; asked the sweet
young thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not officially&mdash;but at heart, always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder you did not get in Government Secret
Service. You would have been invaluable,&#8221;
cooed one of the ladies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem! Yes, but Burnett &amp; Burnett needed
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;but how noble of you to stay in
Wakely when the logical place for you to be was
Washington,&#8221; declared Miss Willie. Then she
asked vaguely: &#8220;Do they bury Secret Service
agents in Arlington?&#8221; Nobody knew, so nobody
answered, and Miss Willie blushed furiously, fearing
that Major Simpson might guess the foolish
thing that was in her mind when she asked the
seemingly inconsequent question. Miss Willie had
a way of breaking into a conversation following
her own train of thought rather than the subject
under discussion, and the guests at Maison
Blanche were accustomed to her peculiarity and
paid little attention to it. One solemn looking
old lady, who said little but missed nothing, gave
a deep gurgling chuckle. This old lady&#8217;s name
was Mrs. Trescott. She had occupied a small
back bedroom at Mrs. Celeste Waite&#8217;s for as many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
years as Major Simpson had occupied the large
front one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trescott&#8217;s chuckle was fortunately
drowned by the dinner gong. The boarders
trooped in and fell on the <i>purree de pois</i> with the
same gusto they would have employed had it
been called plain pea soup. As soon as the first
pangs of hunger were satisfied the conversation
of the parlor was resumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Major Simpson, you haven&#8217;t told us
what this naughty girl looks like,&#8221; said one of
the ladies. &#8220;Of course she is beautiful and
charming and very chic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think she is any of these things,&#8221;
said the Major. &#8220;She is quite insignificant looking
and her clothes are not of the latest style,
though they are of very rich material. Her shoes
are quite good and she is intellectual and well
educated; speaks French with a good accent and
reads Greek. Those high-brow crooks are the worst
of all and the hardest to catch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Boeuf a la mode</i> to-day,&#8221; said Mrs. White
by way of informing the assembled company that
French with an accent was eaten at her table
if not spoken. And one of the young men at
the far end of the room said in a hoarse whisper:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>&#8220;That means biled beef.&#8221; But Mrs. Celeste
White never heard anything she did not want to
hear.</p>

<p>There were three persons at Maison Blanche
that might have been called thorns in the flesh
or flies in the amber. They were two frivolous
young men and one young woman who utterly refused
to play the game of its being a French
<i>pension</i> and who openly made game of Major
Simpson, calling him Sherlocko and asking him
where Dr. Watsonia was. They had all their fun
to themselves, however, as the other inmates
loved to look upon their dinner as table d&#8217;hote
and were sure that Major Simpson in flesh and
blood was much cleverer than Conan Doyle&#8217;s fictitious
detective. Mrs. Trescott was the only person
who derived any amusement from the bad
manners of the three young persons and she
could not help giving her famous gurgling
chuckle when any of their witty remarks
touched her risibles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you say pois meant cat?&#8221; one of the men
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, peas! Why?&#8221; from the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I thought it must mean cat or maybe
kitten because it&#8217;s called purry and it sure does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
purr as it is taken in out of the cold. Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody involuntarily stopped eating and
listened except one deaf old lady who was drinking
her pea soup with such gusto that the noise
she made did sound ridiculously like the purring
of a cat.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trescott chuckled and the three naughty
ones giggled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. White, you should hear the thrilling
things Major Simpson has been telling us about
a wicked shoplifter at Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s,&#8221; said
one of the ladies as the soup dishes were removed
and there was a lull in the business of
eating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoplifter?&#8221; asked one of the young men
known as Jimmy Blaine. Jimmy was a cub reporter
on a morning paper and his life was lived
with his ear cocked for news. &#8220;Do tell us about
it Sher&mdash;Major Simpson.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Major, forgetting all about Jimmy&#8217;s profession
and glad of the chance to entertain a new
audience, one that had heretofore been a scoffing
one, plunged again into the tale of how he
had run down Josie O&#8217;Gorman to her lair. He
waxed eloquent over the account of Mrs. Leslie
and her doughnuts and coffee, even mentioning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
the pink parasol he had given that lady in her
childhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now all we have to do is round up the
whole gang through this slip of a girl. She thinks
she is clever but she is no match for Sylvester
Simpson.&#8221; The Major sat back and beamed on
his listeners, visibly swelling with pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope he don&#8217;t bust on me,&#8221; Jimmy&#8217;s side
partner, Kit Williams, whispered to the naughty
young woman who was always ready to giggle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us the name of this awful young person,&#8221;
begged Jimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, young man! When you get to be as
old as I am and as experienced you will realize
that one mustn&#8217;t tell names and tales too.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this juncture Aunt Maria poked her head
in the dining room door and announced:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Celeste, Major Simpson&#8217;s phone air a
ringin&#8217; lak sompen wa&#8217; on fiah. I&#8217;d go up an&#8217;
answer it myse&#8217;f if it would do any good&mdash;but
when folks wants Major Simpson they wants
him an&#8217; I reckon they couldn&#8217;t use no substerchute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, no doubt a development!&#8221; said the Major
as he hurried to his room to quiet the persistent
ringing of the telephone bell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>He returned before the next course of the
table d&#8217;hote was served. His genial pink face
was beaming and like Kilmansegg, father of the
immortal one of the golden leg:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Seem&#8217;d washing his hands with invisible soap</div>
<div class="verse">In imperceptible water.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Just as I said&mdash;a development,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;It was Mr. Theodore Burnett on the
telephone. He informs me that the articles, purloined
from his establishment this forenoon, have
been returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how thrilling! Did he say by whom?&#8221;
asked the coy one.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was not necessary. I did not even ask
him who returned them. I knew.&#8221;</p>

<small>JIMMY BLAINE GETS A SCOOP</small></h2>
</div>

<p>There were two morning newspapers in Wakely;
one pink and one yellow. On week mornings
half of the town read the pink journal and the
other half the yellow one. On Sunday mornings
the whole town read both. Jimmy Blaine worked
for the yellow one.</p>

<p>It was Jimmy Blaine&#8217;s regular business to go
out on any consignment the powers that be might
send him. It was his irregular business to make
news if there was no news, thereby adding to his
fame and bulging out his weekly pay envelope.
While the Major was telling his tale Mrs. Trescott
was the only one to notice how shiny Jimmy&#8217;s
eyes were and how quick and almost feverish was
his breathing. Before the last course was served
Jimmy jumped from his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;S&#8217;cuse me, but I must be a-hustling. No,
Miss Celeste, no <i>souffle aux pruneaux</i> for me this
evening,&#8221; in answer to the hostess&#8217;s proffer of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
prune whip. &#8220;S&#8217;long everybody! See you in the
morning.&#8221; Jimmy was gone.</p>

<p>Several chuckles bubbled up from the depths of
Mrs. Trescott&#8217;s satin bodice. That evening, when
Mrs. Trescott made her usual weekly pilgrimage
to the kitchen to speak to Aunt Maria and slip
her the customary Saturday night tip she gave
her an extra five cents, commissioning her to purchase
the Sunday morning yellow journal for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moughty &#8217;stravagant Mis&#8217; Trescott when
they&#8217;s allus pufectly good Sunday papers a goin&#8217;
ter waste &#8217;roun&#8217; here. All you is got ter do is
jes&#8217; wait a while. Major Simpson has one, an&#8217;
Miss Celeste has one an&#8217; Mr. Jimmy Blaine is
mo&#8217;n apt ter have two or three. I allus say &#8217;taint
no trouble ter start Monday mornin&#8217; fiah at this
here Mason Bluemange. If you want ter save
yo&#8217; nickel I&#8217;ll see that you gits the very fust
paper that anybody gits through with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very kind, Maria, but I want one all
to myself to-morrow morning, and want it before
anybody has pawed over it and mixed it up. I
have an idea there will be something of especial
interest to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trescott was right. Jimmy Blaine had
not foregone the pleasures of prune whip for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
nothing. He had rushed pell mell to the office
and frantically pounded out on an extra typewriter
the whole story of Major Simpson and the
shoplifter. He had named no names, thereby
carefully sidestepping any chance for a libel suit,
but he had so accurately described Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s
that the whole of Wakely could but guess
the department store mentioned in the story. The
stage setting was realistic, the local color perfect,
but the young journalist had let his fancy run
riot where description of characters were concerned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trescott received her private Sunday
morning newspaper, literally damp from the press.
Aunt Maria was what she called &#8220;an early stirrer&#8221;,
and the first newsboy that shouted his
wares in the neighborhood of Maison Blanche was
nabbed and made to deliver by the intrepid old
cook, who patiently climbed the two flights of
steps to Mrs. Trescott&#8217;s third-floor-back hall bedroom
and poked the paper in her door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you am, Mis Trescott, an&#8217; a cup er cawfy
ter tide you over come brekfus time. You mus&#8217;
be &#8217;spectin&#8217; of some funeral notice ter make you
so besirous of a private paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Maria well knew that Mrs. Trescott had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
to watch her pennies very closely and the extravagance
of five cents spent for first peep at a
newspaper could mean little short of a death and
a funeral.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps!&#8221; chuckled the lady, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll come
read the news to you after while, Maria. I am
more than obliged to you for your kindness. No
doubt the coffee will help me bear up,&#8221; and then
the old lady gave another deep soul-satisfying
gurgle as she unfolded the damp newspaper and
ran her eyes eagerly over the news columns.</p>

<p>There it was, just as she knew it would be, but
better, so much better!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the rascal, the young rascal! He has
made a romance of that old fool Major&#8217;s finding
the widow from his own part of the country and
her helping him to track the criminal. He even
has in the doughnuts and coffee and the pink
parasol.&#8221;</p>

<p>It might be said that Mrs. Trescott stopped
chuckling and chortled. What difference did it
make if one was poor and old and condemned to
spend one&#8217;s days in a third-floor-back hall bedroom
if one had a sense of humor equal to Mrs.
Trescott&#8217;s. Her humor was the type that needed
no second person with whom to enjoy the ridiculousnesses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
of life. Her solemn countenance gave
no inkling to the outside world of the riot of fun
going on within. The gurgling laughter that
sought an outlet was to the uninitiated no more
mirthful than the bubble of air arising from an
old submerged mud turtle, appearing on the surface
of the water and breaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to hear what the Burnetts have to
say this morning,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;Oh, that will
be unprintable I am sure, but our Jimmy Blaine
could make copy of it nevertheless. And the little
shoplifter&mdash;no doubt she is happy at being
put in the paper as beautiful beyond compare,
with a dark mysterious past that tugs against her
better nature&mdash;but the better nature prevails
and she returns the stolen goods. I wonder Jimmy
did not announce an engagement between her
and Mr. Theodore Burnett. I think I&#8217;ll suggest
it to him. A suggestion is all that is necessary
to our Jimmy. Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the mean time Jimmy was sleeping the sleep
of a cub reporter happy over a scoop and the fact
that he had cleared a neat little sum on the extra
columns of space he had filled so successfully. Kit
Williams, his friend and room mate, had seized
on the early edition Jimmie had brought home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
with him and his mirth was loud and lusty over
what Jimmy had done to the Major.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee. Ain&#8217;t he the kid?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I could
kiss him where he sleeps if he wasn&#8217;t so unshaved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You try it,&#8221; muttered Jimmy sleepily, having
come to life just enough to hear Kit&#8217;s ravings.
&#8220;You try it and you&#8217;ll never shave again.&#8221; He
then turned over and pulled the covers over his
tousled head, hoping to be lost to the world until
dinner time, breakfast offering no inducements
to one who had been up all night making news
for the greedy public.</p>

<p>Miss Willie Watts was greatly excited over
the article. It seemed to her very astonishing
that the &#8220;paper&#8221; should know so much about
something that had only just happened. At first
she did not connect Jimmy Blaine with the story
but when she did all she could say was:</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did he know so much about the appearance
of the poor wicked shoplifter when Major
Simpson did not tell him any more than he
did me? And how did he know the widow was
handsome and dashing, the one who made the
doughnuts and coffee? Major Simpson never
said so in so many words. Ah me! All widows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
are handsome and dashing, it seems. I wonder
if this won&#8217;t make the poor Major sick. I hope
he won&#8217;t die&mdash;&#8221; and then she began dreaming
of his tombstone and how it would look:</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Sylvester Simpson, beloved husband
of Wilhelmina&mdash;&#8221; etc.</p>

<p>Mrs. Celeste White read the story and thought
Jimmy was pretty clever but wished he had mentioned
that the doughty hero lived at Maison
Blanche.</p>

<p>&#8220;A very good chance for some free advertising
and I might just as well have had it,&#8221; she
grumbled. &#8220;Young people seem never to think
of such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Major read the whole paper before he
came to the part of the magazine section which
carried his story. It was his custom to have
breakfast in his room on Sunday morning so that
he might take his ease before making the elaborate
toilet he felt to be necessary for one whose
duty and pleasure it was to pass the plate in
church.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this? What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he cried, glaring
excitedly at Jimmy&#8217;s lurid headlines. &#8220;Story
of Seductive Shoplifter&mdash;dashing widow&mdash;doughnuts
and coffee&mdash;pink parasol&mdash;reunited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
after years of sad separation&mdash;Ahem&mdash;handsome
detective&mdash;Tracked to her lair shop girl
returns purloined articles! All will be forgiven
and beautiful maiden will continue her labor at
large department store so popular in the city of
Wakely. Of course her identity will remain a
secret&mdash;no person but the wily detective and
the generous employer being aware of her identity.&#8221;
The poor man groaned aloud and let his
second cup of coffee get chilled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, who can have done this? Ah&mdash;that
wretched Jimmy Blaine! I forgot he was connected
with the press. This vile sheet has always
disgusted me. I never intend to read it
again,&#8221; and then the old gentleman settled himself
to con every word of Jimmy&#8217;s scoop. He
found it rather pleasant to be written up as
handsome and gallant, and the romance between
himself and the Mrs. Leslie hinted at in the article
was on the whole quite gratifying.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Burnetts! What will they think?&#8221;
While no names were mentioned there could be
little doubt of the identity of the persons in the
story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let them think what they choose,&#8221; was Major
Simpson&#8217;s final decision. &#8220;It is not for me, Sylvester<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
Simpson, to account to the young Burnetts
for my method of tracking criminals.&#8221; And
then he proceeded to justify himself for having
talked too freely before a cub reporter and even
persuaded himself that the publicity given the
shoplifting episode was a stroke of finesse that
only a master mind, such as his, would have been
capable of originating.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can manage Charles,&#8221; he said to himself,
&#8220;but I am not so sure of Theodore. He is an
opinionated youngster.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the mean time the &#8220;opinionated youngster&#8221;
was doubled up with laughter over the magazine
section of the Sunday paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just when we thought we could put our hands
on the criminals! Oh, Major Simpson, Major
Simpson, what a legacy our father and grandfather
left us in your portly person! And what
will the little O&#8217;Gorman say to this?&#8221;</p>

<p>What the little O&#8217;Gorman thought we may never
know, but what she said was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, me, oh, my! As my father used to say;
&#8216;The best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft
aglee.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>She then betook herself to the quiet and peace
of her own little bedroom, there to work out a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
plan and incidentally to read a few pages in her
book of books, hoping her clever father might
have left some words of wisdom bearing more directly
on misplaced publicity than on the schemes
of mice and men.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie&#8217;s indignation knew no bounds when
she read what the newspaper said about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dashing widow indeed! I never dashed in
my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And certainly you never widded,&#8221; said Mary,
trying not to laugh. &#8220;But, dearest, you should
be proud that your coffee and doughnuts got into
print, although anonymously. After all, nobody
will know whose they were unless you tell them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be sure I&#8217;ll not do that. But one
thing I am going to tell if I have to do it with my
dying breath: I shall tell Sylvester Simpson that
he is a pompous old idiot.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE QUARREL NEXT DOOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Josie was right; the song of the frogs meant
spring was on the way&mdash;in the air&mdash;in the
ground&mdash;in one&#8217;s bones. The Leslies&#8217; apartment
was hot, hot to suffocation. The janitor,
following in the footsteps of most janitors, had
made up an extra hot fire in the furnace because
it was Sunday and because it was a warm Sunday.
When Josie sought the quiet of her own room to
escape the reiterated wailings of Mrs. Leslie and
to read her precious little book, she found the atmosphere
oppressively heavy. To escape it she
raised her window and leaned far out, drinking
deep of the soft spring air. The little back yard
was showing signs of coming to life. A brave little
daffodil had poked a green nose up through the
black earth and a foolish peach tree actually had
a few precocious buds on one of its slender
branches.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be nipped and deserve to be,&#8221; thought
Josie. &#8220;But I reckon they can&#8217;t help it any more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
than I can resist almost falling out of the window
in search of air.&#8221;</p>

<p>Someone else was evidently of the same mind,
as a window next to the one from which Josie
was leaning was raised with some vehemence and
an impatient voice, strangely familiar to Josie,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, but it&#8217;s hot in this hole! I hate to think
of summer&#8217;s coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&mdash;ah, how I long for warmth&mdash;&#8221;
drawled a woman&#8217;s voice with a foreign accent.</p>

<p>Josie decided it was the Kambourians&mdash;mother
and son. Then a goodnatured growl from the interior
of the room gave evidence that Papa Kambourian
was not far off.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Nom de Dieu</i>&mdash;close the window, Roy! Do
not you understand that Mamma and I have air
enough during the week days to last us over the
blessed Sabbath. That is the worst of these
United States and all who happen to be born here
as were you, <i>mon bon enfant</i>&mdash;air always air!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I! How about me being shut up in a
shop all week with a bunch of silly girls, working
like a dog&mdash;and when I do pull off a deal to have
Mamma fall down on her part? I can&#8217;t get over
it&mdash;losing the things.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>&#8220;Now, now, boy!&#8221; and the goodnatured
growl bordered on anger. &#8220;Let Mamma be! It
was unavoidable. Has she not already wept
oceans of tears? What are a few yards of
wretched lace and a bit bauble of a gold bag to
poor Mamma&#8217;s feelings? Let be, <i>mon fils</i>, and try
again. A few more hauls and we will have enough
to set up a small shop in the great metropolis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for me! I&#8217;m through I tell you&mdash;through
for good and all. I&#8217;m sick of the whole
wretched business. You and Mamma can keep
on being foreigners all you want but I&#8217;m an
American boy&mdash;almost a man&mdash;and I want to
pull loose. I could make as much money walking
straight as I do crooked.&#8221; His voice rose
angrily and Josie felt that the boy was on the
verge of tears in spite of his assertion that he
was almost a man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut the window!&#8221; roared the father. &#8220;Such
foolish babble is enough to start the whole
neighborhood talking!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, now!&#8221; soothed the woman&#8217;s voice.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you and Papa quarrel. I know my little
Roy will not what you call pull out yet and leave
poor Mamma before she gets enough pretty
things to start a little <i>boutique</i>. Shut the window<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
like a gentle boy because the air may make Papa
sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can air make one sick who sits all day
on a sidewalk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now you reproach poor Papa and Mamma
because they sit all day and sell the pencils
and shoe strings and paperrs,&#8221; whined the woman,
though it was easy to grasp that the whine
in her voice was pure burlesque. &#8220;Was I made
for such a life? No, I tell you, nevaire!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this juncture the window was closed with a
vigorous slam and the eavesdropper heard no
more. She had heard quite enough however to
set her steady little heart a thumping.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am almost as big an idiot as my worthy
brother in arms, Major Simpson,&#8221; Josie took
herself to task. &#8220;Anybody with a grain of sense
would have known all along what I had to open
a window to find out. Thank goodness for the
over zealous janitor. I&#8217;ll give him a generous tip
to-morrow. But mercy on us, how carefully I
must go now. I can hardly trust myself not to
burst in on the Leslies and tell them the whole
thing. One thing I know, I must call in help from
the police department, as much as I hate to get
any clumsy folks mixed up in this. I know what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
I&#8217;ll do&mdash;&#8221; She made a feverish dive for her hat
and jacket, and grabbing up her gloves rushed
through the living room, saying in passing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Expect me back when you see me but know
that I am not running off for more than an hour
or so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There now!&#8221; gasped Mrs. Leslie. &#8220;What a
strange girl she is after all. What do you think
is the matter, Mary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she has a clue and is following it up.
All I am wondering is where she got it in such a
short time and if she will tell us all about it later
on. It is certainly interesting to have a person
like Josie to rent a room from us, isn&#8217;t it
Mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so; but I wish she wouldn&#8217;t be
so sudden,&#8221; sighed Mrs. Leslie. &#8220;I think she
ought to tell me what her clue is because I am
sure I could help her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary smiled. She was not so sure. Up to the
present her mother had been more of a hinderance
than a help to their little lodger. As for suddenness;
nobody could have been more sudden
than that lady in accepting without question the
opinion of old Major Simpson merely because he
had come from her county and had presented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
her with a pink parasol when she was quite a
tiny girl.</p>

<p>To a clever girl like Josie, it was an easy matter
to find out the name of the reporter on the
yellow journal who had spread himself so lavishly
on the shoplifting story. First to the newspaper
office where, it being a morning paper, the
business of the day had not begun. The office was
open, however, and a janitor was lazily sweeping
the floor and grumbling because the one who took
care of a daily newspaper office had no Sunday to
speak of. The man at a desk agreed with him as
did also the telephone girl whose business it was
to handle the private switchboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I speak with the city editor?&#8221; Josie
asked meekly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in yet!&#8221; growled the man at the desk.
&#8220;Anything I can do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please, if you will be so kind&mdash;I want
the name and address of the reporter who had
the shoplifting story in the paper this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatcher want with it? It&#8217;s against the
policy of the paper to divulge names and addresses.
The management holds itself responsible
for all stories published in its columns and
the management has not come down yet.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>&#8220;I merely wanted to give the man a chance on
another scoop, but since you are evidently not
desirous of scoops I&#8217;ll look up the other paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that? Scoop? Give it to me! I&#8217;ll get
hold of Jimmy Blaine in a minute. The truth
of the matter is, young lady, I am the management
but it&#8217;s policy to keep it dark when anybody
is on the war path. I was afraid you were
one of the wronged ladies in Jimmy&#8217;s story&mdash;but
I might have known you weren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you can get hold of this Jimmy I&#8217;d
be very much obliged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the nature of your story? Anything
like the one this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, this one is a true story. There is mighty
little that is true in the scoop of the morning except
perhaps the pink parasol and the doughnuts.
Would it be against the policy of the paper for
you to divulge just what part of the management
you are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem! I am part owner and managing editor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll do, but please get this Jimmy
here as fast as you can so I can tell the tale to
both of you at once and save time and breath.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jimmy Blaine was forced to uncover his head
and listen to his room mate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>&#8220;Boss wants you and wants you in a hurry.
He says never mind dolling up, but just come
along. He&#8217;s on the phone now and Miss Celeste
says it must be important because he sounds so
brisk.&#8221; Thus spake Kit Williams, going through
the operation on sodden Jimmy known as &#8220;cold
pigging&#8221;, that is, applying a wet sponge to a
sleeper&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hide! Get up and go to the phone,&#8221;
insisted Kit as Jimmy snuggled down in the bed
clothes and again covered his tousled head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw gee! Have a heart, cantcher? Don&#8217;t go
joking me, Kit, that&#8217;s a good boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, lose your job if you want to.
What&#8217;s it to me? You blooming idiot, didn&#8217;t you
hear me say that the boss himself is hollerin&#8217; for
you. I reckon he&#8217;s got a mouthfull to say about
that lurid tale you pulled off in this morning&#8217;s
paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He saw it before it went in,&#8221; growled Jimmy.
&#8220;If there is any trouble it is up to him.
Ain&#8217;t he the management?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought that would wake you up. Now get
up and put on your dressing gown&mdash;here it is&mdash;here
are your slippers. Never mind your boudoir
cap, just slip along to the phone.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>Jimmy meekly obeyed. There was no use in
grumbling when one&#8217;s boss was on the line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he said in a voice as sweet as honey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Be right down. Don&#8217;t
let her get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Breakfast? No sir! What&#8217;s breakfast! Never
eat on Sunday, that is, breakfast. Be down in
a jiffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a wide awake Jimmy who, after turning
on a cold shower, tore back to his room and began
to throw on his clothes like a lightning change
vaudeville artist.</p>

<p>&#8220;So long, Kit, old fellow. Something big is
up but I don&#8217;t know what. It&#8217;s got something to
do with Sherlocko Simpson, I think, but I&#8217;ll see
you later,&#8221; and the youngster was out on the
street and running for a trolley in less time than
it would have taken the fire department to answer
an alarm.</p>

<small>JOSIE SETS A TRAP</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Jimmy Blaine did not now just what he was
expecting but he knew it was not a quiet, business-like
young person like Josie who showed no shyness
and at the same time no brazenness, but
with the utmost composure stated the case and
put it up to the management whether or not it
was worth while to pursue the scoop unearthed
by the cub reporter. As soon as Jimmy breezed
in, all on fire for more sensational news, Mr. Cox
introduced him to the visitor. Josie gave him a
boyish handshake and then plunged into the matter
in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place I am a detective, Josie
O&#8217;Gorman from Washington and late of Dorfield.
My father&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the O&#8217;Gorman!&#8221; from Mr. Cox.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; beamed Josie. &#8220;I am here with Burnett
&amp; Burnett to catch the shoplifters that have
been busy lately.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>Jimmy surreptitiously produced a pencil and
endeavored to get hold of a linen cuff, but Josie
stopped him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Mr. Blaine, none of this is for publication
as yet. You can get the whole story in
good time and it will be a good one I am sure. I
have come to the newspaper for help because in
my experience the live wires are on newspapers
and not on the police force. I cannot say for
sure that the police of Wakely would bungle, but
I can say that the police of Dorfield would and
have. My father believed in the press as a great
detective power and I have had more help from
a young newspaper man in Dorfield than all the
police; in spite of the fact that Chief Lonsdale
of Dorfield is my very dear friend. But this
young Dulaney&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Bob Dulaney of the &mdash;th Regiment?&#8221;
cried Jimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;Bob Dulaney!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee! This is great! Shake again!&#8221; cried
Jimmy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve spent many a night lying in the
mud near Bob, over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you know Danny Dexter, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Know him? Know him like a book! Why
Danny was my Father Confessor. Many a time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
he&#8217;s told me what&#8217;s what. You see, I was the kid
of the regiment and some of the fellows seemed
to think it was up to them to make me walk chalk.
I walked it all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve no doubt you did,&#8221; twinkled Mr. Cox.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Danny Dexter married my best friend;
but that&#8217;s another story and we&#8217;d better get back
to business. Please let me say that I&#8217;m glad I
came to the newspaper for cooperation as I&#8217;m
pretty sure a friend of Bob Dulaney and Danny
Dexter is going to be on the job and deliver the
goods,&#8221; said Josie.</p>

<p>Jimmy Blaine grinned happily, proud that his
boss should hear him praised through his
friends.</p>

<p>Josie plunged into a recital of the Kambourians
and how she had been mystified by them from the
moment she saw them on the street that first Sunday
in Wakely. She told of the baffling likeness
the youth had to someone she had seen before; of
her finding board in the same apartment house
with them, by chance as it were; of Miss Mary
Leslie&#8217;s encounter with a beggar in the hallway
and of her identification of this beggar as the
man whose habit it was to sit all day at the front
entrance of Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s. She then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
touched on Major Simpson&#8217;s laughable mistake
concerning her own character.</p>

<p>&#8220;He thinks I am the shoplifter and has had me
under surveillance ever since I have been employed
by his firm. I only grasped this fact yesterday.
I knew he was following me around but I
was conceited enough to fancy it was my methods
that interested him. I thought maybe he knew
I was my father&#8217;s daughter and was trying to
learn something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jimmy gasped:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are the one he thinks he has trapped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same! Thank you for making me such
an irresistible vamp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! What! Is your story not true?&#8221; Mr.
Cox looked both alarmed and irritated.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s practically what old Simpson told right
out at the boarding house table. Of course I kind
of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;embellished it a little, but the
story is almost as he gave it&mdash;doughnuts and coffee
and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is what Major Simpson thinks is true, but
suppose I go on with my tale. I am sure Mr.
Blaine wrote the matter up quite correctly according
to newspaper etiquette&mdash;certainly there is no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
handle for legal trouble,&#8221; soothed Josie. &#8220;If
I don&#8217;t mind being called a beautiful criminal I
am sure Mrs. Leslie should not mind being published
as a fascinating widow. Anyhow, no
names were used, so what&#8217;s the difference?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right,&#8221; said Mr. Cox,
smoothing out his troubled brow. &#8220;Pray proceed.
Your story is most interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please tell us&mdash;did you return the goods to
Mr. Burnett?&#8221; asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>Then Josie told of the twisted newspaper and
her discovery of the lace and gold mesh bag and
her taking the articles to Mr. Burnett. She also
told of having tried to locate the haughty Miss
Fauntleroy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now&mdash;to sum up: Miss Fauntleroy is
a fake and wishes to conceal her address. The
newspaper I bought from the old woman who sits
at the rear entrance of Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s had
passed through the hands of Miss Fauntleroy and
she put the stolen goods in the paper and twisted
it up and returned it to the old woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Golly!&#8221; was all Jimmy could say. &#8220;And
this Miss Fauntleroy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It came to me all of a heap this very day that
it was she to whom the young Kambourian had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
the haunting likeness. I had seen her in the store
and been rather interested in her because she
seemed different from the other employees. She
is evidently the daughter of the house and the
old beggar is none other than the mother, Madame
Kambourian. The father begs at the front
door, the mother at the back, and the daughter
takes what suits her fancy and deposits it now
with Mamma and now with Papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you said this Madame Kambourian was
handsome,&#8221; objected Mr. Cox. &#8220;Handsome and
not at all old&mdash;hardly old enough to be the
mother of the youth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but age is easier to assume than youth.
She had on a clever make-up. I wonder how much
she takes in each day, selling papers and never
having the change.&#8221; Then Josie proceeded to
tell all that she had overheard through the open
window, and how this was made possible because
of the janitor&#8217;s having been too lavish with the
owner&#8217;s coal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we must round up the whole bunch. The
boy is mixed up in it somehow, though he is still
a mystery to me. I could not gather just exactly
what he does to increase the family income
but I am sure it is something of which he is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
proud. I feel rather sorry for the boy because
I am sure he&#8217;d like to cut the whole bunch and be
honest. The entire family is interesting to me.
The man and woman seem so fond of each other
and so considerate. I&#8217;ll give you my word they
are much more loving than many married couples
one sees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not seen this Miss Fauntleroy there,
have you?&#8221; asked Mr. Cox. &#8220;You are not really
sure that she belongs there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so sure that I could swear to it in a court
of justice, but so sure that I could safely say I&#8217;d
eat my hat if she is not,&#8221; laughed Josie. &#8220;I
think she must be twin sister to this boy. I don&#8217;t
want to brag, but when I get a hunch like this it is
apt to be right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, let&#8217;s proceed on the assumption
that Miss Fauntleroy is in reality Miss Kambourian.
What next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next we must plan a campaign of watchful
waiting. I will take charge of the interior of Burnett
&amp; Burnett&#8217;s, keeping a never closing eye on
Miss Fauntleroy. I must have help to look after
the beggar at the front and the one at the back
as well as the Kambourian apartment, both front
and back.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>After much thought and discussion Mr. Cox
and Josie, with the alert intelligence of Jimmy
Blaine to advise with them, decided the thing
was too big not to call in the assistance of the
police. The blue coats might bungle, but at least
they could be set to watch the alley behind the
apartment house and report anything out of the
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a new chief here who is not so
hide bound as the old one was; in fact, he is very
down-to-date in his methods. I am sure he will
cooperate with us. Call him up, Jimmy, and
see if he is at his office. Sunday is no more of a
holiday to the police than to newspaper men.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief proved to be having a holiday in spite
of its being Sunday, but an alert young sergeant
answered the call and even expressed himself as
willing to come to the newspaper office instead of
having the newspaper office come to him. The
tale was quickly told. Sergeant Tanner agreed
with Josie on the plan of procedure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who am I, anyhow, to take issue with the
daughter of the great O&#8217;Gorman? I reckon you
are a chip off the old block, Miss, because if you
had not been you never would have caught that
Markle bunch. We know all about that here in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
Wakely. We know how you tracked down that
chap in Atlanta, too, the one who had put his
step-sister-in-law in a bug house and was planning
to marry her and cop the fortune. We know
about the kidnapping case in Louisville, also.
You see we aren&#8217;t named Wakely for nothing.
Anyhow we are awake enough to keep up with
the detective news.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie could not help being flattered by Sergeant
Tanner&#8217;s recognition of merit but she
merely blushed a little and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all luck, absolutely nothing but luck
that made me successful in those cases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope your luck will keep up,&#8221; said Mr.
Cox.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course plain clothes men are what we will
need,&#8221; said the sergeant, &#8220;and I think I&#8217;ll be
one of them. Shall I take over the apartment
house and the entrances to Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; agreed Jimmy ruefully, &#8220;but
what&#8217;ll I be doing? I want to get in on this somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might be an inside man and help me
in the shop,&#8221; said Josie. &#8220;Somebody must watch
Major Simpson or he&#8217;ll bungle things.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>Sergeant Tanner was much amused over the
poor Major and his bungling.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a terrible dub at detecting. If he had
called us in on this shoplifting trouble we might
have helped him but old Simp thinks he knows
it all and he is as ignorant of the game as a new
born babe. Now, Miss O&#8217;Gorman, I&#8217;ll detail some
sharp men to keep an eye on the apartment house
to-night and others to look after it every minute
of the day to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll come in the shop and buy things
and even make up to Miss Fauntleroy,&#8221; suggested
Jimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get too much in evidence,&#8221; cautioned
Josie. &#8220;And Sergeant Tanner, be sure to keep
a watch over the blind beggar man in front. As
for the woman with papers, I have an idea she
will not come to work for a day or so, not in the
guise of an old woman, at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie felt it wise to see Mr. Burnett for a
moment before returning home to inform him
how matters were progressing and to ask his approval
of the move she had made in taking both
newspaper men and police force into her confidence.</p>

<p>He approved highly. &#8220;Between the two you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
will be sure to get help. As for poor old Simpson,
I wish he would have a slight indisposition
that would keep him away from the store to-morrow.
Hasn&#8217;t he messed things up, though?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not! Anyhow I am hoping the Kambourians
are so foreign they don&#8217;t read the American
newspapers. The chances are they know
nothing of the publicity given the matter.&#8221;</p>

<small>MRS. LESLIE TURNS DETECTIVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;How can anybody call Monday a blue day?&#8221;
asked Josie the next morning as Mrs. Leslie
served a dainty breakfast to the two girls. &#8220;It
seems to me to be the most wonderful morning
in the whole week. Even wash day holds no terrors
for me. It always has been the very best
day of all for me, a kind of weekly Easter, a
day in which the whole world can start afresh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you like it,&#8221; said Mrs. Leslie,
grimly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been brought up to feel differently.&#8221;
Mrs. Leslie was having a mental and
moral reaction from the excitement of the Saturday
and Sunday just passed. &#8220;Monday was
always a serious day with us in the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mother,&#8221; laughed Mary, &#8220;you surely
do not consider it your religious duty to be blue
on Monday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly religious&mdash;but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mrs. Leslie, please don&#8217;t be too down-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
or too busy because I have a task for you
that I am sure you can&#8217;t resist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure child, because I am planning
to clean beds to-day. The sun is shining
and it is a good thing to be beforehand with beds.
I can sun the things in the back yard&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very thing!&#8221; cried Josie delightedly.
&#8220;The more you are out in the back yard the better
because I do so want you to keep an eye on
those Kambourians from the rear. They will
not be the least suspicious of a busy housewife
engaged in the legitimate search connected with
beds and early spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie&#8217;s Monday gloom lifted a little. Being
a private detective was rather more interesting
than the usual humdrum of housekeeping.
She promised Josie to keep a sharp lookout on
the neighbors.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never can tell about foreigners. They
are more than apt to be off color,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;If they do anything peculiar while you are
away, how must I proceed, Josie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Proceed to call up Burnett &amp; Burnett, phone
number, Preston 11, and ask for Mr. Theodore
Burnett&mdash;take no substitute. Tell him who you
are and what is happening. He will do the rest.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
The Kambourians may be absent all day but the
chances are the woman will not leave the house.
The place is even now being watched by detectives.
But detectives do not always see everything
and I am depending on you to see what
they don&#8217;t see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Detectives watching the house now!&#8221; cried
Mrs. Leslie, &#8220;I should say this isn&#8217;t a blue Monday.
I am thrilled indeed to be in the midst of
a mystery. Hurry up and get off, girls, so I
can get out in the back yard and see what I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mother, don&#8217;t overdo it,&#8221; cautioned
Mary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me overdo it!&#8221; said Mrs. Leslie, indignantly.
&#8220;I know exactly how to behave under the circumstances.
I am going to run in and out with
pillows and blankets and carry out one slat at a
time and put mattresses in the windows and let
them fall in the yard. I just wish you and Josie
could see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we could,&#8221; laughed Josie. &#8220;I am
sure you are going to do it splendidly and I am
so glad you are interested in it. I just know
you will beat all the police in Wakely in helping
to bring these crooks to justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls were hardly out of the house when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
Major Simpson was calling Mrs. Leslie on the
telephone. The dear lady had not bargained for
such a development and it was with difficulty that
she commanded her voice to answer the smug
old man as she knew he must be answered. She
was sorry she had not asked instructions from
Josie on how to meet such an emergency, but
Major Simpson took matters in his own hands
and there was little for her to say but yes and
no.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how is my one time neighbor this morning?
I hope she is well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has that artful young person left your
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she is going to return to her labors at
Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she say concerning the article in
the paper yesterday? You saw it, did you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was unfortunate that it should have been
published but newspapers are ever on the alert
for just such stories; human interest, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>&#8220;Was the artful person angry at the publicity
given the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t remember exactly, but I think she
said &#8216;Gee.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I shall be for dismissing the young
person, but Mr. Theodore Burnett evidently
thinks otherwise. These young men think they
know it all, but I have not dealt with crime all
these years without acquiring some knowledge of
the youthful criminals. There is no reforming
them. Well, Miss Polly, I thank you for cooperating
so wonderfully with me in this matter.
And you are not angry that the story&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;concerning
the coffee and doughnuts and er&mdash;er&mdash;the
pink parasol should have leaked out?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie&#8217;s: &#8220;Old idiot!&#8221; slipped out before
she knew it but Major Simpson&#8217;s: &#8220;What?
What?&#8221; brought her to her senses and she covered
her retreat with a cough and smoothed
things down by: &#8220;Old intimate friends,&#8221; hoping
that intimate and idiot might sound more or
less alike over a telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you will not let this young person
remain under your roof,&#8221; the Major proceeded.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
&#8220;I feel in a measure er&mdash;er&mdash;responsible for
you, Miss Polly, and hope you will allow me to
dictate to you to some extent. This young woman,
even though Mr. Theodore Burnett is so soft
hearted as to keep her in the employ of his firm,
is hardly a fit person to associate with you or
your&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;charming daughter&mdash;because I
am sure she is charming if she is your daughter.
I wish you would promise me that this O&#8217;Gorman
person will not remain in your home another
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie hung up the receiver with a click.
She was possessed with a fury against the interfering
Major that made it impossible to continue
the conversation although all that it entailed at
her end was a monosyllabic reply. She could
well picture him at the other end of the line, indignantly
upraiding the telephone operator for
having so rudely cut him off. Her bell rang again
sharply but she scorned answering it and went
about her combined business of bed airing and
female sleuthing with added vigor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miserable old man that he is! Wants me
to turn a girl out in the street just because he
has made up his mind she is a thief. I don&#8217;t feel
bad any longer about hoodwinking the old idiot.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
He is narrow and mean or he wouldn&#8217;t ask me
to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie was right in her guess&mdash;Madame Kambourian
did not leave the house that day. She,
too, found many things to busy her on that bright
Monday. Much sorting and airing seemed to
be going on in the apartment next to the Leslies.
Several times Mrs. Leslie looked up from her labors
and saw the pleasant, plump countenance of
Mrs. Kambourian peering at her from the open
window. Once she nodded and a cheerful &#8220;Good
mor-r-rning,&#8221; was the response.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice day for preliminary spring cleaning,&#8221;
ventured Mrs. Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ver-r-ry nice,&#8221; said the neighbor, placing a
silver fox scarf and a sealskin jacket on the window
sill where the sun could shine upon them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not expecting moths this soon are
you?&#8221; queried Mrs. Leslie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moths? You mean the cr-r-eatures that feed
upon the fur-r and wool? Ah, Heaven forbid!
I merely sun my things because I love the sun
and then it is war-r-m and I may not need them
now for many months. I pack them up per-r-haps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the open window Mrs. Leslie could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
see a large packing box and a wardrobe trunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting ready to leave! It looks to me as
though Josie should know this,&#8221; she said to herself.
Preston 11 was immediately called for by
the eager amateur detective and Mr. Theodore
Burnett put on the line.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Mrs. Leslie, Mr. Burnett, Josie
O&#8217;Gorman&#8217;s friend. Please tell her the foreigners
next door to us are getting ready to move
and the woman is sunning a silver fox scarf and
a sealskin jacket, both of them too good for anybody
living in this house to use. I haven&#8217;t any
good furs of my own but I can tell them a mile
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Theodore Burnett smiled and made a note
of the fact that the amateur lady detective had
no furs but knew good ones a mile off. This
was the same lady of whose judgment in the matter
of dry goods Major Simpson had spoken so
highly, knowing from the first that Josie O&#8217;Gorman&#8217;s
clothes were of material too good to have
been bought from the salary of a novice at the
notion counter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clever lady!&#8221; he muttered in an aside,
&#8220;Must keep her in mind.&#8221; He thanked her profusely
for the information and begged her to keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
a sharp lookout through the day. &#8220;The evidence
you have gathered is invaluable, my dear
lady,&#8221; he assured her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The window is open and I can see a large
packing box and a wardrobe trunk and this Kambourian
woman is folding and packing as fast
as she can. I gossiped with her a moment, quite
casually, and she told me herself she was thinking
of moving. You&#8217;d best tell Josie right off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right! Thank you, and good bye!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Burnett had just hung up the receiver when
Major Simpson came bustling into the office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Theodore, and how are you this nice
sunny morning? Spring in the air, my boy,
spring! I have come to see you concerning this
O&#8217;Gorman person. Singular case&mdash;quite singular!
She is actually working behind the notion
counter this morning quite as though nothing had
happened&mdash;not at all abashed&mdash;but meek withal,
meek and I must say modest. She dropped her
eyes when I passed and had occasion to stoop
and hide her head. Modest, quite modest! I feel
more inclined to deal gently with one who shows
becoming modesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Burnett could not help a sly smile but he
controlled himself and said rather sternly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>&#8220;Major Simpson, I ask you to let me do what
dealing is necessary with Miss O&#8217;Gorman, in fact,
I ask you most emphatically.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was as near as either of the Burnett
brothers had ever come to commanding the old
gentleman whom they had so unwillingly inherited
from their predecessors, but Mr. Theodore
Burnett had no intention of letting Major Simpson
mix himself up in the matter of Josie O&#8217;Gorman
and her methods any more than possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly!&#8221; said the elderly detective,
stiffly. &#8220;I have never been one to overstep authority,
but I feel it is my duty to warn you,
young and untried, against the machinations of a
type like this O&#8217;Gorman person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Major Simpson, I am warned&mdash;and
now I shall go and interview the young lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be too easy on her,&#8221; insisted the determined
Major. &#8220;I am&mdash;&#8221; But what he was saying
Mr. Burnett did not wait to hear. He felt that
Josie must be told immediately of the silver fox
scarf and fur coat sunning in the rear window
at Number 11 Meadow Street, and of the large
packing box and wardrobe trunk and of Mrs.
Leslie&#8217;s gossip. He was in the elevator and making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
for the street floor of the store before the
Major&#8217;s sentence was completed.</p>

<p>All was as Major Simpson had reported.
There was Josie O&#8217;Gorman conducting herself
as though nothing had happened, selling tapes
and pins with as much industry as she would
have shown had her living depended upon it.</p>

<p>At the jewel novelty counter across the aisle
Miss Fauntleroy moved with deliberate grace,
totally unconscious of the fact that the sandy
haired little person with the unimportant countenance,
who seemed so busy making unimportant
sales of bone buttons and shoe laces, never once
let the haughty beauty get out of her line of
vision.</p>

<small>THE GIRL IN THE RED TAM</small></h2>
</div>

<p>There was an undercurrent of excitement at
Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s on that sunny Monday morning.
Every clerk in the store had either read or
heard of the article in the Sunday paper. There
was much conjecture as to the identity of the
beauty who had purloined the goods and then returned
them to Mr. Burnett.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds like they were talking about me,&#8221;
said Gertie Wheelan, patting her permanent wave
complacently. &#8220;That is, all but me being a thief.
Min knows I never took a bunch of lace off her
counter because when she missed it I was standing
right here by her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I know you didn&#8217;t, Gertie,&#8221; laughed
Min, &#8220;but the fact that you were standing near
me when I missed it isn&#8217;t very good evidence
that you didn&#8217;t take it. I reckon your character
is about the best evidence that you didn&#8217;t take
it. You are a vain old goose, Gertie, but everybody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
knows you are as honest as you are vain,
and that is going some.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gertie did not know whether to be complimented
or not, but since it was pleasanter to be
flattered than to be censured she decided to be
flattered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a great mind to ask old Simp who it
was,&#8221; whispered Min.</p>

<p>&#8220;I already did that,&#8221; put in Jane Morton,
&#8220;and he had the cheek to pretend he did not
know what I was talking about. You see no
names are mentioned in the paper. He hummed
and hawed and stuck out his chest and patted his
white waistcoat and said: &#8216;Really, my dear
young lady, I cannot conjecture er&mdash;er&#8217; and he
swelled up a little more and went on: &#8216;Of course
I cannot deny that I know what is going on in
this establishment, but prudence compels me to
dissemble er&mdash;er&mdash;to dissemble.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls all laughed at Jane&#8217;s droll mimicry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you had a chance to ask Josie O&#8217;Gorman
what she thinks?&#8221; asked Min. &#8220;Josie is
a mighty wise little girl and I betcher she has
her own thinks on this subject just as she has
on every other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I asked her,&#8221; replied Jane, &#8220;and she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
just laughed and said maybe she was the wicked
beauty her own self. She said she might as well
be because old Simpson had never taken his eye
off her the whole morning. Sure enough, there
the old fellow was, circling around the notion
counter glaring all the time at Josie. I don&#8217;t
see how she stands it. I&#8217;d have to call him down
and either make him quit his foolishness or offer
some explanation. Josie went on making sales
and paid no attention to him except once when
he came close up to her she ducked under the
counter so she could relax into a giggle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls had met for a moment near the cashier&#8217;s
desk. Similar groups were forming and
breaking through the entire building.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who do you think it is?&#8221; was asked again
and again.</p>

<p>Now and then some know-all would make a
positive assertion such as: &#8220;I know on good
authority who it is but I am not at liberty to
divulge the name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; and Min nudged Jane Morton.
&#8220;There&#8217;s Mr. Theodore Burnett talking to Josie
O&#8217;Gorman. Old Simpson has left the floor. I
saw him going up on the elevator. I wonder what
our junior member wants with Josie. Look! She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
is evidently getting leave from the head of the
department. Jiminy crickets! If she isn&#8217;t leaving
with the boss!&#8221;</p>

<p>Min was right. Josie was leaving the floor
with Mr. Theodore. The information Mrs. Leslie
had telephoned must be treated seriously and
without delay. The police must be warned and
Josie felt the time had come for a search warrant
to be issued on the Kambourians. She accompanied
Mr. Burnett to his office and soon had the
police station on the line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any report from the detectives watching 11,
Meadow Street?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing there!&#8221; was the answer from
the man at the desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have inside information that the
woman is packing up, so you better get a search
warrant ready and keep a close watch on the
premises,&#8221; she commanded. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let the men
leave their post for a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hump!&#8221; grumbled the police sergeant,
&#8220;anybody would think&mdash;&#8221; But what anybody
would think was lost on Josie who hung up the
receiver with a click.</p>

<p>&#8220;Asleep at the switch as usual!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;But I must hurry back to my counter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
I wish that old Major Simpson would get busy
and help me instead of circling around me with
his eyes hanging out on his cheeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I make him stop?&#8221; asked Mr. Burnett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, perhaps he is safer watching me than
he would be helping me. Anyhow that Jimmy
Blaine is on the job all right. He has been popping
in and out of the store all morning pretending
to buy socks and ties and matching ribbons
for his imaginary wife. He is a clever lad. I
have a notion I&#8217;d better give up selling things
for a while if you will supply a girl for my
counter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, yes!&#8221; agreed Mr. Theodore.</p>

<p>When Josie did not return to her duties of
selling notions the girls at the neighboring counters
commented on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you reckon she&#8217;s been shipped?&#8221; wondered
one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly&mdash;she&#8217;s too good at the business and
as regular as clock work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny she went off with the boss and
has been gone an age and no sign of her. I do
hope she isn&#8217;t in any trouble. Look! There&#8217;s
a green girl at the button counter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatcher reckon is the matter? That old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
Simp is at the bottom of it I betcher. He&#8217;s been
bugging his eyes out at Josie for ever so long.
Look, there he is back again. He looks worried
over something.&#8221; Thus spoke Min, but her flow
of eloquence was cut short by a customer demanding
to see some Irish lace.</p>

<p>&#8220;The best is none too good for me,&#8221; asserted
the customer sharply. She was a young woman
with bobbed black hair very much becurled, a
mouth so painted it gave one the impression that
she had been eating poke berries, cheeks to match
not only lips but a string of red, red beads twisted
several times around her throat and hanging to
her waist. In her hand she carried a bright red
swagger stick. Her hat&mdash;a red tam&mdash;was worn
far on one side. Brows and lashes were blackened
to match the blue-black hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said Min demurely. &#8220;The best is
none too good but it may be too costly,&#8221; she
muttered under her breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the cost&mdash;that is my affair. Ah,
this is very sweet,&#8221; she said, pulling out a bunch
of the costly lace and spreading it out on the
counter. &#8220;But show me other widths and patterns.
Have you any point d&#8217;esprit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we have no point d&#8217;esprit,&#8221; said Min<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
with ill concealed impatience. Her lunch hour
had struck and she felt it was hard lines to be
forced to show this painted flapper expensive
lace that she was sure she had no idea of buying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some duchesse, too,&#8221; demanded the determined
shopper. &#8220;Nothing better than that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Min was forced to produce more and better
lace. The counter was strewn with boxes of
the priceless merchandise. Miss Fauntleroy was
ready to go out for luncheon. She paused for a
moment to speak to Min. All she said was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is not the store clock slow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Min looked up from the lace she was showing
the possible purchaser and compared her wrist
watch with the large time piece hanging on the
opposite wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; she said, and resumed her labors.</p>

<p>Miss Fauntleroy proceeded leisurely towards
the front door. The much made-up young person
who had been so intent on lace, without one word
to Min, turned and followed the haughty beauty.
The aisles were crowded with shoppers but the
bobbed haired, red mouthed flapper kept close
behind Miss Fauntleroy.</p>

<p>Outside in the sunshine the dark beggar with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
a patch over one eye sat and in a wheedling tone
besought the passers-by to buy his pencils.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ver-r-y fine&mdash;ver-r-y sharp&mdash;&#8221; he quavered.
&#8220;Buy&mdash;sweet lady&mdash;buy.&#8221; His one eye
had appeal enough for two. Many persons
dropped coins in his outstretched hat.</p>

<p>Miss Fauntleroy stopped in front of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buy sweet lady&mdash;buy a pencil&mdash;&#8221; She
stooped to select one from the box of red, white
and blue pencils he held on his knees. From that
moment astonishing things began to happen, both
within and without the department store of Burnett
&amp; Burnett&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Within a sudden hue and cry was raised by
the distracted Min.</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch her! Catch her quick!&#8221; she cried to
Major Simpson who was still walking curiously
and cautiously around the notion counter, as
though he expected Josie to bob up at any moment
from behind the counter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch what? Catch whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That girl with the bobbed black hair in a
red tam and red beads!&#8221; screamed Min. &#8220;She&#8217;s
&#8216;klept&#8217; a whole bunch of lace&mdash;two bunches&mdash;maybe
three&mdash;the finest in the shop. At least I
reckon she did it. Go after her and get her.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Don&#8217;t stand still. I can&#8217;t go myself because I&#8217;ve
got to keep an eye on all this stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Simpson trotted obediently towards the
front entrance. This was a new turn of affairs&mdash;a
shoplifter and not the elusive Josie. He
bumped into Mr. Theodore Burnett in the aisle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another thief!&#8221; he spluttered. &#8220;Girl with
bobbed black hair and red beads. Lace again&mdash;front
entrance&mdash;better come with me!&#8221;</p>

<small>JOSIE O&#8217;GORMAN&#8217;S VICTORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Outside the store even more stirring things
were being enacted. When Miss Fauntleroy
leaned over with the seeming intention of selecting
a pencil from the beggar&#8217;s box there had
been a quick exchange of glances between the
proud beauty and the one-eyed mendicant, an
exchange of glances and also the passing of a
parcel which was slid from the wide, bell shaped
sleeve of the young woman into the open breast
of the man&#8217;s shabby coat. The movement was
so rapid that no one who had not been on the
lookout could possibly have seen it. But someone
was on the lookout and that one was no other
than the flapper of the bobbed black hair and
the red, red mouth. She did a very remarkable
thing for a flapper.</p>

<p>As quick as a flash she whipped out something
from the pocket of her tweed suit, which, when
one came to think of it, was of rather sober pattern
for one so flapperish and not at all in keeping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
with the red beads and startling tam. The
article she drew from her pocket flashed in the
sunlight for a moment and then&mdash;snap! snap!
and a pair of handcuffs gleamed on the wrists
of the one-eyed beggar before the astonished Miss
Fauntleroy could straighten up from the selection
of a pencil.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him get away!&#8221; came in commanding
tones from the mysterious flapper. The remark
was addressed to none other than Jimmy
Blaine, who had been pretending to be a corner
masher during such moments as he could spare
from the business of shopping for a highly fictitious
family.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust me!&#8221; was his cheery rejoinder as he
laid a heavy hand on the shoulder of the beggar
who was now trembling like a leaf.</p>

<p>The girl with the bobbed black hair then caught
Miss Fauntleroy by the wrist, at the same moment
producing another pair of handcuffs from
the capacious pockets of her tweed suit. She
endeavored to snap them on the wrists of the
struggling girl, but Miss Fauntleroy proved too
strong, and jerking free, started to run. Swift
as had been the action a crowd had gathered, as
crowds will, and closing around the struggling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
pair cut off all avenues of escape. The black
haired girl must have known something about
the game of football for she made a flying leap
and caught the taller girl in an iron grip. They
swayed together and fell.</p>

<p>In the scrimmage that ensued more startling
things happened. Two hats came off, and with
them two heads of hair. A red tam and a bobbed
black wig were torn from the flapper, disclosing
the closely coiled sandy hair and well shaped
head of none other than Josie O&#8217;Gorman. The
elaborate coiffure belonging to Miss Fauntleroy
also came off with the stylish picture hat.</p>

<p>The combatants staggered to their feet. When
Josie caught sight of her antagonist, standing
hot, sullen and ashamed, so hemmed in by the
crowd there was no escape, a wave of pity came
over her. The proud and haughty Miss Fauntleroy
was only a poor misguided boy. The marcelled
wig with all its puffs and coils had turned
a handsome lad into a beautiful young woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; was all Josie could say. &#8220;And I
thought you were your own sister all the time.
I hate to put handcuffs on you&mdash;won&#8217;t you come
along without them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I&#8217;m through. The game&#8217;s up and I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
glad of it. I&#8217;ll go along with you all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Simpson, closely followed by Mr. Burnett,
was trying to make his way through the
crowd. He knew something was going on and
his superior intelligence must be in demand. He
also knew that lace had been stolen and that a
person with black bobbed hair was the thief. It
was irritating that it was not Josie O&#8217;Gorman
who had been caught in the act, but then, any
thief was better than no thief at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, let me through! I am a detective.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word detective was an open sesame for
him. The crowd divided and he and Mr. Burnett
passed through to the scene of the fray.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some scene it was!&#8221; Mr. Burnett described
later on to his mother and sisters. &#8220;There was
little Miss O&#8217;Gorman, her suit all dusty and dishevelled,
her hat gone and her face made up in
the most absurd manner with blackened brows
and painted lips. She had by the hand a young
boy dressed as a girl. Handsome? Handsome
as Hermes! Shame and anger were both depicted
on his countenance, and his head, with its
dark, closely cropped curls, was hung in deep
dejection. On the pavement wigs and hats were
so much in evidence that one might have thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
there had been a battle royal and both fighters
had been decapitated. I had no idea who the
youth was at first, not recognizing &#8216;Miss Fauntleroy&#8217;
without her wig. Miss O&#8217;Gorman&#8217;s famous
string of red beads had broken and were
scattered all over the pavement. It looked to
me like a million beads, some of them as big as
bantam eggs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Simpson, acting true to form, broke into
the ring blustering as usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this?&#8221; he demanded. Not recognizing
Josie with her bizarre make-up or Miss
Fauntleroy without her wig, the old gentleman
stood gazing at the pavement. He suddenly remembered
Min&#8217;s words: &#8220;Black bobbed hair
and red tam.&#8221; He stooped and picked up Josie&#8217;s
wig and hat. It looked as though a tragedy had
just been enacted at the front entrance of Burnett
&amp; Burnett&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who has done this thing?&#8221; he asked solemnly,
glaring all around.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I did,&#8221; laughed Josie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say she did!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy Blaine,
who was still clinging to the handcuffed beggar.</p>

<p>At Josie&#8217;s words Major Simpson looked at her
more closely and through the paint recognized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
the dangerous criminal, Miss Josie O&#8217;Gorman.
Just then a policeman pushed his way through
the crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Officer, arrest this woman,&#8221; commanded Major
Simpson officiously, pointing an accusing finger
at the grinning Josie. &#8220;I fancy, madam,
you will find this no laughing matter when you
are safely behind bars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes! She is the culprit!&#8221; cried the
handcuffed beggar. &#8220;Good Mr. Officer, let me
loose. I have done nothing but sit here trying
in my poor-r way to make a living selling the
pencils&mdash;and see, I am a good American, because
I sell only the red, white and blue of our flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do your duty, officer,&#8221; insisted Major Simpson.
&#8220;Arrest this young woman. She is a shoplifter
and depraved beyond belief for one so er&mdash;er&mdash;young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And beautiful,&#8221; smirked the irrepressible
Josie. She then turned to the officer, all levity of
manner falling from her. &#8220;I am detective Josie
O&#8217;Gorman, Sergeant Fagan. I have just caught
this boy red-handed. Open his father&#8217;s coat and
you will find a heap of costly lace which has been
stolen from Burnett &amp; Burnett within the last
few minutes. I&#8217;ll turn this youth over to you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
I am sure his case is one for the juvenile court
to deal with. The father, who goes by the name
of Kambourian and lives at 11 Meadow Street,
is the one to arrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lace was found just as Josie had said,
three bunches of it hidden in the ragged coat of
the patch-eyed beggar. The patrol wagon was
called and father and son were carried off, Kambourian
loudly asserting his innocence in spite
of the lace found in his manly bosom. He declared
to the end that he had no idea how it had
got there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll follow as soon as I can wash my face,&#8221;
Josie whispered to Sergeant Fagan. &#8220;Keep a
close watch on the old bird. I believe the young
one, poor fellow, is glad the thing has broken
and I fancy you&#8217;ll have no trouble with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Burnett had been a silent witness to the
encounter between Josie and Major Simpson&mdash;silent
and amused. He had promised Josie to let
her manage the affair and he had done so, although
he had been sorely tempted to step in and
interfere when the self satisfied old gentleman
had so peremptorily commanded the policeman
to arrest the little detective. Now he wondered
what stand Major Simpson would take and for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
a moment felt sorry for the hereditary employee
of the firm of Burnett &amp; Burnett. He need not
have wasted his sympathy, however, as that gentleman&#8217;s
self esteem was proof against any shock.
He immediately took possession of the stolen lace
as though he, and he alone, had been responsible
for its recovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I was sure we could track down the
criminal. A little patience and eternal vigilance
and lo, the thief is caught!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; said Josie, &#8220;but not always the
right thief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Patience, I say, patience and astuteness will
unravel any mystery,&#8221; continued Major Simpson,
ignoring Josie&#8217;s remark. &#8220;You will remember,
Mr. Burnett, that I said from the beginning that
Miss O&#8217;Gorman was not what she seemed. You
will grant me that, eh?&#8221; And thus did the old
man talk on and on, seeming actually to feel that
it was his cleverness that had caught the shoplifters.</p>

<p>The net had closed around the Kambourians&mdash;husband,
wife and son. The search warrant revealed
a great store of stolen articles, taken not
only from Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s but from almost
every shop in Wakely; dainty, choice articles, just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
the kind with which to stock a novelty shop, which
had been Madame Kambourian&#8217;s ambition.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had only just acqui-r-r-ed enough
things,&#8221; she wailed after she and her husband
were sentenced to a term in the penitentiary.
&#8220;And I would have been all moved and away if
that bad, bad per-r-son had not warned the author-r-ities
that I was planning to flit. Such a
kind looking per-r-son too! But one nevair-r-e
can tell who is false.&#8221;</p>

<p>Be it said in favor of Kambourian, the
man, that his deepest concern was for &#8220;poor
Mamma&#8221; and his chief regret that she should
not have escaped.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she had only told us that the young lady
had bought the paper in which the articles of
value were twisted we would have been more careful,&#8221;
he said to Jimmy Blaine, who interviewed
him for the great soul stirring scoop. &#8220;She
merely said the lace and things had been lost.
We had no knowledge how and we did not question
poor Mamma too closely because we are always
so tender of her. She is so gay and we did
so hate to make her sad. This beggar&#8217;s life was
hard on poor Mamma&mdash;to sit all day and whine
for pennies when she loved so to live and be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
happy. And clothes&mdash;ah <i>mon Dieu</i>, how poor
Mamma does love to dress up&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I,
too, like the life. Ah me! All that is to be postponed&mdash;but
perhaps&mdash;some day&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy, Roy, was taken before the juvenile
court where the wise young judge listened to all
Josie had to tell him of the unfortunate environment
in which he had been raised. She told of
the conversation she had overheard through the
open window and of the boy&#8217;s evident reluctance
to proceed in the dishonest course mapped out
for him by his parents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the boy told the judge, &#8220;I have hated
it always, but because I had the knack of mimicry
and could pass myself off for a girl I was forced
to wear those fool clothes and pretend I was
&#8216;Miss Fauntleroy.&#8217; I despised myself all the
time, despised myself and began to despise them,
I mean my mother and father, although they did
love me and were always kind to me except that
they made a thief of me. Of course if I was going
to be a thief I determined to be the very cleverest
thief in the business, and if it had not been
for you, Miss O&#8217;Gorman, I believe I could have
been. Anyhow I am glad it is all over and I&#8217;m
going to be as straight now as I used to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
crooked. All I want is a chance. Gee, I&#8217;m glad
to be able to wear pants all the time! I never
have been a sissy, and many is the time I felt
like jumping in the river when I had to wear those
silly skirts and picture hats. It was poor Mamma&#8217;s
fault. Not that I blame her, for she did
so want to have a nice little shop of her own and
dress up in pretty things. She always said when
once we got together enough things we would go
into a real business and stop stealing. Poor
Mamma! I wish I could do something for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie thought that a prison term might do more
for poor Mamma than anything else. At least
it might teach her that honesty was the best policy
for her to pursue in the future.</p>

<p>A chance was given Roy. The judge of the
juvenile court sent him to an industrial school
where it would be possible for him to work out
his own salvation. He was as a brand snatched
from the burning and, by God&#8217;s grace, snatched
in time. Josie was sorry for the youth and Mary
Leslie wept many tears in her pity.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was so handsome,&#8221; she sobbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He still is,&#8221; consoled Josie, &#8220;and now it
can be &#8216;Handsome is as handsome does,&#8217; as my
father used to say. This thing broke just in time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
to save that poor boy from becoming a confirmed
criminal. As it is, I bet anything he&#8217;ll pull
through and come out of that school a good fellow
and a useful citizen. He is interested in the stage
and I hope he&#8217;ll do something big in the dramatic
line some day. The way he acted <i>Miss
Fauntleroy</i> was little short of genius.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;ll come out all right,&#8221; said Mrs.
Leslie, &#8220;but I have my doubts about foreigners.
Anyhow I am glad we took you to board, Josie,
because it has made life much more interesting.
Just to think of Mr. Burnett&#8217;s writing me a letter
of thanks for the part I took in helping to
catch that woman! Of course I appreciate the
handsome check he sent me and the fur jacket
he sent Mary, but I think more of the letter than
I do of the check and the jacket. After all, the
detective tales I have read did something for
me, if only to make me keep my eyes open for
mix-ups.&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Simpson decided after due consideration
to accept Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s offer of a pension
and he determined to retire from the active labors
of a detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course this is a good time to retire, while
I am yet in the hey-dey of my powers,&#8221; he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
heard to say to Miss Willie at Maison Blanche.
Mrs. Trescott was the person who heard him say
it and it was with difficulty that she controlled
her merriment. &#8220;I have just been the means
of tracking down for my firm a family of desperate
criminals and&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;out of gratitude
to me the Burnett Brothers have offered to
pension me on&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;full pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How wonderful!&#8221; trilled Miss Willie. &#8220;But
you will remain in Wakely, surely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes! In fact I should not like to go far
from Burnett &amp; Burnett&#8217;s because they may need
my advice at any moment. My advice&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;is
most important.&#8221;</p>

<p>Josie had made many friends at Burnett &amp;
Burnett&#8217;s, and they were one and all very sorry
that she was leaving the notion counter and
Wakely.</p>

<p>&#8220;We felt all the time that you were a little
different,&#8221; Jane Morton told her. &#8220;Min and
I used to talk about it, but we just thought you
had picked up more education than we had and
that was what made you different. If we had
ever known that you were a detective we might
have been a little shy. But we have learned that
a woman detective may also be a human being.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
As for that &#8216;Miss Fauntleroy,&#8217; my blood boils
when I think of her&mdash;him. Anyhow we never
did have much to do with him because we always
mistrusted her&mdash;er&mdash;him. She never did seem
natural and now since she has turned out to be
a boy, I see the reason. One thing to his credit,
he was a gentleman, even when masquerading as
a girl, and never tried to get chummy with us.
I feel a little sorry for him and hope he will turn
out all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night Josie accepted Mr. Theodore Burnett&#8217;s
insistent invitation to take dinner at his
home. There was no longer any good reason
for refusal, though in truth she sought no such
reason.</p>

<p>Never was there a gayer, livelier party. Mr.
Burnett&#8217;s sisters, May and Lily, vied with one
another in little acts of gracious hospitality, and
the aged mother, austerely garbed in a voluminous
black dress, gave the lie to her years and her
garb as fires kindled in her deep set eyes at the
retelling of the capture of the shoplifters. Mr.
Theodore was high in his praise and colorful in
his narration.</p>

<p>Josie, vivacious enough in other matters, had
little to say concerning her latest exploit, having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
learned from her father that modesty and justifiable
pride are becoming handmaidens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Miss O&#8217;Gorman,&#8221; said Mr. Theodore
when the dinner was over, &#8220;let us come back to
a matter of business. You know how we appreciate
your efforts and how valuable your services
have been to our firm. However, it is hardly
to be hoped that this will definitely stop all shoplifting.
When the story has cooled, the whole
wretched business will flare up again. Through
diplomacy we have succeeded in influencing Major
Simpson to retire on full pay. No doubt he
deserves it, for as my brother Charles points out,
loyalty deserves reward, and the Major was certainly
loyal. Now we are in need of a house detective
and we are willing to substantially increase
the pay where results are as certain as
mere loyalty. A-hem, the&mdash;the place is yours,
Miss O&#8217;Gorman, if you will take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the astonished Josie could form a reply
the aged mother broke in:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will accept, and I want you to
come here to live. This is a big house, plenty
of room, and you will add a great deal of life to
our colorless world. I have reared four children
who have been successful in a matter-of-fact way.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
I feel that I would like to mother you&mdash;you with
your startling ingenuity. Won&#8217;t you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You simply <i>must</i>!&#8221; chorused Lily and May.
&#8220;Please do. Just think of the things we could
think up to do,&#8221; and they clapped their hands in
anticipation.</p>

<p>Josie was troubled. She appreciated the kindness;
sensed its deep sincerity. But she knew
her own spirit&mdash;knew that dull routine could not
long hold her interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; she began simply, &#8220;but I must
get back to Dorfield and my work. The Higgledy
Piggledy Shop needs me, and somehow I seem
to need it. Then, too, Captain Lonsdale writes
me that there is work to do right away&mdash;a peculiar
case that he thinks I can handle. I&mdash;I
simply can&#8217;t tell you how I feel, but surely you
will understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; nodded the mother. &#8220;You are too
big a girl for a little place. We will miss you,
but I am glad that you are ambitious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t ambition,&#8221; answered Josie, and a
big tear stood in her eye. &#8220;It is a sort of trust,
the carrying on of my father&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; boomed Mr. Theodore, vigorously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
blowing his nose, &#8220;you must not forget
us. Some day you may feel like accepting the
offer. It is an open one and may bring you back
to Wakely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poof!&#8221; protested Lily. &#8220;As if she must
wait for <i>that</i> to bring her back. She is going
to visit us at least once every year and give us
a complete account of herself&mdash;won&#8217;t you,
Josie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to,&#8221; Josie answered quietly.</p>

<p>She little realized what the coming year would
bring and how thrilling would be that first account.
Some hint of it came to her a few days
later when she reached Dorfield and called on
Captain Lonsdale. The task put before her called
for the best that was in her; an undertaking
worthy of the efforts of her illustrious father.</p>

<p>Sobered by the importance of the coming quest,
she seemed to have lost some of her spontaneity
when her friends, Irene and Mary Louise, rapturously
greeted her return to the Higgledy Piggledy
Shop.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said Mary Louise a little later
when the first warm gush of welcome was over,
&#8220;you have changed. You seem so quiet and&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
sort of sweetly pensive. I declare, Irene, I
believe she is in love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Josie, comically wriggling her
nose in her old manner, &#8220;with my work.&#8221;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
